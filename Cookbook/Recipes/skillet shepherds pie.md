## Ingredients
- [ ] 1 pound ground beef- [ ] 1 cup chopped onion- [ ] 2 cups frozen corn, thawed- [ ] 2 cups frozen peas, thawed- [ ] 2 tablespoons ketchup- [ ] 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce- [ ] 2 teaspoons minced garlic- [ ] 1 tablespoon cornstarch- [ ] 1 teaspoon beef bouillon granules- [ ] 1/2 cup cold water- [ ] 1/2 cup sour cream- [ ] 3-1/2 cups mashed potatoes (prepared with milk and butter)- [ ] 3/4 cup shredded cheddar cheese

## Steps
1) In a large skillet, cook beef and onion over medium heat until meat is no longer pink; drain. Stir in the corn, peas, ketchup, Worcestershire sauce and garlic. Reduce heat to medium-low; cover and cook for 5 minutes.

2) Combine the cornstarch, bouillon and water until well blended; stir into beef mixture. Bring to a boil over medium heat; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Stir in sour cream and heat through (do not boil).

3) Spread mashed potatoes over the top; sprinkle with cheese. Cover and cook until potatoes are heated through and cheese is melted.

Freeze option: Prepare beef mixture as directed but do not add sour cream. Freeze cooled meat mixture in a freezer container. To use, partially thaw in refrigerator overnight. Heat through in a large skillet, stirring occasionally and adding a little water if necessary. Stir in sour cream and proceed as directed.
