Servings: 2

## Ingredients
- [ ] 2 medium-sized sweet potatoes- [ ] 2 tablespoons maple syrup- [ ] 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature- [ ] 1 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature- [ ] 1 teaspoon vanilla- [ ] 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon- [ ] 1/4 teaspoon salt- [ ] 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg- [ ] 1/4 teaspoon ground ginger- [ ] FOR MARSHMALLOW TOPPING:- [ ] Mini marshmallows or jumbo marshmallows, cut in half

## Steps
1) Adjust oven rack to center position and preheat oven to 375Â°F. Line a large rimmed baking sheet with foil. Wash sweet potatoes, scrubbing off any dirt, and pat dry. Arrange potatoes on baking sheet and cook for 1 hour.

2) After an hour of cooking time, insert a fork into the center of each potato. If potatoes are not done, bake for 15 more minutes or until completely tender.

3) Using an oven mitt or kitchen towel to handle hot potatoes, slice a thin piece off the top of each sweet potato and discard. Scoop out the flesh from each sweet potato, leaving a 1/4-inch layer intact to create a sturdy shell. Transfer the potato pulp to a bowl and mash well with maple syrup, butter, cream cheese, vanilla, cinnamon, salt, nutmeg, and ginger, stirring until smooth and well blended (I use an electric stand mixer for this step).

4) Scoop the sweet potato mixture into a gallon-sized plastic baggie and twist the top closed to create a piping bag. Cut a 1-inch piece off one corner of the bag and pipe the mixture into the sweet potato shells, evenly dividing it between them (alternatively, you may use a spoon to fill the shells).

5) Top each sweet potato with marshmallows, bake for 7 to 10 minutes, watching closely until desired level of toastiness is reached.


## Notes
If some of your potatoes are larger than others, you may have to pull the smaller ones out of the oven after an hour and bake the remainder for an additional 15 minutes.
