Easy cinnamon apple baked oatmeal with a crumbled streusel like topping

Servings: 6

## Ingredients
- [ ] Oatmeal:- [ ] 1 tablespoon butter- [ ] 1 cup of oats - you can use either whole rolled oats or quick oats- [ ] 2 gala apples - peeled and cut into ½-inch cubes- [ ] 1½ cups of milk (any kind)- [ ] ⅓ cup of walnuts - crushed (or pecans or almonds)- [ ] ¼ cup of brown sugar (or honey or maple syrup)- [ ] 1 tsp cinnamon- [ ] ¼ tsp salt - adds flavour.- [ ] 1 egg - helps bind everything together.- [ ] Streusel Topping:- [ ] ½ cup of all-purpose flour- [ ] ¼ cup and 2 Tbsp of Brown sugar- [ ] ¼ tsp salt- [ ] 4 Tbsp butter - cubed at room temperature

## Steps
1) Preheat oven to 350 F. Grease a 2-quart oval casserole dish or ramekin with butter or butter spray, then add apples. Toss with cinnamon and bake for 15-20 minutes, or until softened.

2) Remove the dish from the oven and add oats, walnuts, and salt. Stir until evenly dispersed.

3) In a separate bowl, whisk together brown sugar, milk, and egg. Pour on top of oats, making sure everything is submerged in liquid.

4) To make streusel topping, combine flour, ¼ cup brown sugar, salt, and butter in a small bowl. Use your hands to gently work the ingredients together, crumbling the butter into pea-sized pieces and working quickly so that it doesn’t melt. Sprinkle as much of the streusel as you’d like on top of the oatmeal, then bake for 20-25 minutes, or until most of the liquid as been absorbed.

5) Sprinkle the remaining 2 tablespoons brown sugar on top, then place under the broiler for just a couple minutes until the sugar has melted. Watch carefully so it doesn’t burn. Serve hot as is or with a splash of milk.


## Notes
For a creamier oatmeal serve it with a splash of milk right after plating.

How to store: Allow oatmeal to cool completely, then cover and store in the refrigerator for up to 1 week. You can also scoop it into individual portions and store in airtight containers or freezer bags in the freezer for up to 3 months.
