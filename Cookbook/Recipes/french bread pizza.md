Great tasting pizza perfect for that quick evening meal or a party. And at 20 minutes it's faster than a speeding pizza dude.

Servings: 1 loaf French bread 9 inch for two servings

## Ingredients
- [ ] 1 loaf French bread 9 inch for two servings- [ ] Prepared pizza sauce- [ ] Toppings of choice.- [ ] mozzarella cheese

## Steps
1) Preheat oven to 375 convection or 400 conventional.

2) Slice a loaf of French bread horizontally. I used a 9-inch baguette, but any length should be fine. A sub bun would work ok also. But the quality of the bread will determine your taste.

3) Prep toppings. I browned 1/2 pound of Italian sausage and cut some pepperoni in half.

4) Top with sauce. It took about 1/2 cup. Add toppings. Add mozzarella cheese.

5) Bake on middle rack until nicely browned. About 10 minutes.


## Notes
If doing larger amount, it is worth time doing your own sauce. My homemade sauce recipe: One 6 oz can of tomato paste and 6 oz water. 1 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon pepper, 1 clove garlic and 1/2 teaspoon oregano. This will make about 1 1/2 cups of sauce which is three times what I use here for two 9 inch pizzas so you can judge from there.
