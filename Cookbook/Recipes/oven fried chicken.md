Servings: 2

## Ingredients
- [ ] 2 skinless boneless chicken breasts- [ ] Marinade:- [ ] 2 cups buttermilk- [ ] 1 egg- [ ] 1 tablespoon vegetable oil- [ ] Coating - makes way more then you need for 2 so save extra for next time.:- [ ] 2 cups AP flour- [ ] 2/3 tablespoons salt- [ ] 1/2 tablespoons thyme- [ ] 1/2 tablespoons basil- [ ] 1/3 tablespoon oregano- [ ] 1 tablespoons celery salt- [ ] 1 tablespoons black pepper- [ ] 1 tablespoons dried mustard- [ ] 4 tablespoons paprika- [ ] 2 tablespoons garlic salt- [ ] 1 tablespoon ground ginger- [ ] 3 tablespoons white pepper- [ ] Gravy - optional:- [ ] 2 cups chicken broth- [ ] 4 tablespoons flour

## Steps
1) Start with trimming two skinless boneless chicken breasts. Mix 2 cups buttermilk with one egg. Add the chicken and allow to marinade in the refrigerator for 30-60 minutes.

2) Preheat oven to 375 convection or 400 conventional. Mix the 11 spices with the flour.

3) Prepare an oven safe pan with 1 tablespoon vegetable oil. Remove chicken breast one at a time allowing excessive marinade to drain off. Dip in the spice/flour mix. Cover completely, shake to remove excess and place in pan.

4) Give any of the flour mixture that looks dry a light spray of PAM. Allow to set for 20-30 minutes. This will help the coating to stick.

5) Bake until internal temp of 165, about 35-40 minutes. Cooking time will vary some due to oven variations, the size and thickness of the chicken and the pan used.

6) If you want gravy, remove chicken from pan. Mix 1 cup of chicken broth with 4 tablespoons flour either by whisking or in a shaker. Over medium-high heat, add 1 more cup of chicken broth to the pan and bring to a boil. Slowly add the flour mixture while whisking continuously until thickened and then a few more minutes. If some of the breading come off the chicken, leave it in the gravy as flavor bombs.
