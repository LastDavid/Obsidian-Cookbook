3) In a large mixing bowl, combine two 12 oz bags of frozen mixed berries, one 21 oz can of apple pie filling, 1/3 cup sugar, and 1 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon.

## Notes
If you don't want to do the crumble topping, then use one tube of sugar cookie dough crumbled up. I believe the original recipe suggest thawing the frozen berries but just dump them in frozen is fine.
