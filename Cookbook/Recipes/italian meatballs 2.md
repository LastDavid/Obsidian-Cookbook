## Ingredients
- [ ] 1/3 cup plain bread crumbs- [ ] 1/2 cup milk- [ ] 2 tablespoons olive oil- [ ] 1 onion, diced- [ ] 1 pound ground beef- [ ] 1 pound ground pork- [ ] 2 eggs- [ ] 1/4 bunch fresh parsley, chopped- [ ] 3 cloves garlic, crushed- [ ] 2 teaspoons salt- [ ] 1 teaspoon ground black pepper- [ ] 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes- [ ] 1 teaspoon dried Italian herb seasoning- [ ] 2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese

## Steps
1) Cover a baking sheet with foil and spray lightly with cooking spray.

2) Soak bread crumbs in milk in a small bowl for 20 minutes.

3) Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onions in hot oil until translucent, about 20 minutes.

4) Mix beef and pork together in a large bowl. Stir onions, bread crumb mixture, eggs, parsley, garlic, salt, black pepper, red pepper flakes, Italian herb seasoning, and Parmesan cheese into meat mixture with a rubber spatula until combined. Cover and refrigerate for about one hour.

5) Preheat an oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).

7) Bake in the preheated oven until browned and cooked through, 15 to 20 minutes.


## Notes
Some recipes use equal portions of beef, veal, and pork, which is also nice, yet more expensive. These days you can find all sorts of lean-to-fat ratios for ground beef. Most stores sell 90% lean, 10% fat, but I prefer the 80% lean, 20% fat ratio for this recipe.

Once cooked, you can add the meatballs to your favorite prepared tomato sauce for 1 to 2 hours.
