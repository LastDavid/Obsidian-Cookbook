## Ingredients
- [ ] 1 lb ground chuck 85/15- [ ] 1/2 lb ground pork if you can only get a pound, save half in the freezer- [ ] 2 eggs whisked- [ ] 4 slices of Italian bread 5 ounces- [ ] 1 cup bread crumbs I used Italian seasoned- [ ] 4 TBSP grated parmesan- [ ] 1/2 tsp garlic salt- [ ] 1 tsp salt- [ ] pinch of black pepper- [ ] 2 TBSPs chopped fresh parsley

## Steps
1) Preheat oven to 375

2) Soak the bread in cold water for about five minutes, ringing out the excess water and pulling the bread apart with your fingers.

3) Combine the meat, eggs, and parsley in a large bowl. Add the bread. Then add the dry bread crumbs, parmesan, garlic salt, and salt.

4) Using a cookie scoop scoop out the meatballs onto wax paper and then roll them into into consistent balls. Place them on a cookie cooling rack. Place that rack on a baking sheet. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes or until you can cut into a meatball in the middle of the rack and not see pink.
