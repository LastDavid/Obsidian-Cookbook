OMGâ€¦ Crock Pot Cheesy Potatoes AKA Crack Potatoes. So easy. So good. From scratch with raw potatoes, no frozen potatoes here.

Servings: 4 large

## Ingredients
- [ ] 1 pound potatoes raw
- [ ] 6 green onions
- [ ] 1 teaspoon coarse salt
- [ ] 1/2 teaspoon pepper
- [ ] 1 cup sour cream
- [ ] 1 cup cheddar cheese shredded


## Steps
1) Start by peeling and cubing about 1 pound of potatoes. I used two huge russets, but three medium would be just right.

2) Spray a large crock pot with PAM and toss them in. Spread evenly and cook on high for two hours.

3) Mash the potatoes in the crock pot.

4) Clean and slice six green onions.

5) Sprinkle with one teaspoon coarse salt, 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Add the sliced green onion, 1 cup sour cream and one cup shredded cheddar cheese. Add cooked bacon or other things at this point. Mix until combined and then smooth over the bottom of the crock pot.

6) Cook 30 minutes more on high.
