## Ingredients
- [ ] 4 red or yellow medium bell peppers (about 1/2 lb each)- [ ] 2 cups chopped cooked chicken- [ ] 1 1/2 cups Muir Glen™ roasted garlic pasta sauce (from 25.5-oz jar)- [ ] 1 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese (6 oz)- [ ] 3/4 cup Progresso™ Italian panko crispy bread crumbs- [ ] 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese- [ ] 1 tablespoon olive oil- [ ] 2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil leaves, if desired

1) Heat oven to 350°F. Spray 13x9-inch (3-quart) glass baking dish with cooking spray. Cut bell peppers in half lengthwise; remove seeds and membranes. In 4- to 5-quart Dutch oven, heat 3 quarts water to boiling. Add bell peppers to boiling water, making sure water covers peppers. Cook 2 minutes; drain.
