Here is an easy never fail method. You can be a "grill master" too and have and excellent grilled steak in 10 minutes every time.

Servings: 2 Steaks

## Ingredients
- [ ] T-Bone or Porterhouse Steaks about 1 inch thick- [ ] Salt and pepper to taste OR 7:2:2

## Steps
1) Rest the steaks at room temperature for about 1 hour if possible allowing the steaks to come to room temperature.

2) Apply salt and pepper at the start of you resting period. At the end is OK if skipping the rest or you forgot. Use a coarse salt and pepper. I used my 7:2:2 which is kosher salt: pepper: garlic

3) Trim the beef of extra fat. This is important to prevent "flair ups" that will burn your expensive meat.

4) Preheat your grill to maximum. Yep, as hot as it will go. Clean and oil well. Do not just olive oil here due to the low smoke point.

5) Place over direct heat. In five minutes (by the clock) flip the meat. If you are into crossed grill marks, you should have rotated the meat 90 degrees at about 2 1/2 minutes.

6) Grill for approximately three more minutes for rare, four more minutes for medium-rare and 5 minutes for medium (150). Your timing will vary a little so as always, check the temperature. Rest before serving by lightly tenting with foil for 5 to 10 minutes.


## Notes
This is for 1 inch thick give or take a little. 1 1/2 inch max. If you are into to 2 inch thick, different technique is needed. If about 1 1/2 inch be sure to rest to room temperature at the start or the center will be rare... unless that is what you like. 1 1/2 inch will be almost 2 pounds.
