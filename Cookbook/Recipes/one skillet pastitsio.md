## Ingredients
- [ ] 1 tablespoon canola oil- [ ] 2 cups chopped yellow onion (from 1 large onion)- [ ] 12 ounces 93%-lean ground sirloin- [ ] 3 garlic cloves, chopped (about 1 1/2 tablespoons)- [ ] 1 teaspoon dried oregano- [ ] ½ teaspoon kosher salt- [ ] ¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon- [ ] ⅛ teaspoon ground nutmeg- [ ] 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour- [ ] 2 cups 1% low-fat milk- [ ] 1 cup unsalted chicken stock- [ ] 1 (15 ounce) can no-salt-added diced tomatoes, undrained- [ ] 3 ounces 1/3-less-fat cream cheese- [ ] 1 ounce Parmesan cheese, grated (about 1/4 cup)- [ ] 10 ounces uncooked whole-grain penne pasta (such as Ronzoni Healthy Harvest)- [ ] ¾ cup low-moisture, part-skim, pre-shredded mozzarella cheese

## Steps
1) Heat oil in a high-sided 12-inch skillet over medium-high. Add onion and cook, stirring often, until softened and browned, 6 to 8 minutes. Add beef, garlic, oregano, salt, cinnamon and nutmeg; cook, stirring often, until meat is browned, 5 to 6 minutes. Stir in flour and cook, stirring constantly, 1 minute. Add milk, stock and tomatoes and stir with a wooden spoon to loosen browned bits from bottom of skillet. Add cream cheese and Parmesan cheese and cook, stirring constantly, until cheese is melted. Let mixture come to a low boil.

2) Stir in uncooked pasta, ensuring all pasta is submerged. Reduce heat to medium and cook, stirring often, until pasta is just tender, 9 to 11 minutes. Sprinkle with mozzarella; cover and remove from heat. Let stand until mozzarella melts, about 5 minutes. Serve hot.
