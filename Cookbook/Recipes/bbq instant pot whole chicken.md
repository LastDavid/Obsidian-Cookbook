Servings: NUTRITION INFORMATION Yield: 6 servings, Serving Size: 4 ounces

## Ingredients
- [ ] BBQ Rub- [ ] 4 Pound Whole Chicken- [ ] Olive oil- [ ] 1/3 Cup Apple Juice

## Steps
1) Prepare the bbq rub and massage it both under and over the skin.

2) Drizzle some oil in your instant pot.

3) Turn it on to the saute function and allow it to heat up.

4) Place the whole chicken, breast side down in the instant pot. If it is too big to lay down flat you’ll have to brown the skin on the stove top in a large skillet.

5) Cook for a few minutes until golden and turn over, browning the other side.

6) You can leave the chicken in the pot, or we like to use the Trivet so it isn’t sitting in the liquid.

7) Pour in the liquids and close the lid.

8) Set the instant pot to manual high pressure and cook for 30 minutes.

9) Allow the pot to do a slow release for 5-10 minutes and then remove the lid and enjoy!

10) If you’re using a chicken bigger than 4 pounds you may need up to 10 minutes more of cooking time. Watch the internal temperature by watching the instant read thermometer after the initial cook time and make sure the thigh hits the correct temperature according to the information in the post above.
