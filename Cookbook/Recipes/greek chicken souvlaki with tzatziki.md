Tzatziki:

## Notes
Chicken Souvlaki Notes:

To Freeze: Prep the chicken in marinade and place it in a freezer friendly ziplock bag (with the marinade) and freeze it for easy meal prep later. When you are ready to make the Chicken Souvlaki, pull it out of the freezer and let it thaw in the refrigerator overnight. By doing this, you are also marinating the chicken as it thaws. Cook according to above directions once thawed.

Greek Seasoning Notes:

For a smoother texture, you can pur√©e all ingredients for 30-45 seconds in a food processor or use a spice grinder. Use on meats, vegetables, or combine with olive oil for a great dip for bread or pita chips. It can also be used to make a great Greek salad dressing.

Tzatziki Notes:

Tzatziki can be refrigerated for up to 5 days
