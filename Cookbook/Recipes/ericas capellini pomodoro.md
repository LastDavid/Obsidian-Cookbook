# Erica's Capellini Pomodoro

tags: Favorite, Pasta

This is similar to Olive Garden's Capellini Pomodoro - Angel Hair Pasta with Tomatoes, Basil and Mushooroms 

I made this.

Servings: 4

## Ingredients
- [ ] ⅓ cup Olive oil
- [ ] 5 cloves of garlic, minced
- [ ] 2 cans (14.5oz) diced tomatoes
- [ ] 1 can (14.5oz) stewed tomatoes
- [ ] ¼ tsp freshly ground black pepper
- [ ] 4oz fresh mushrooms, sliced (or one small can)
- [ ] 6oz Angel Hair pasta
- [ ] 1-2 cups fresh basil leaves, chopped
- [ ] 1-2 cups Parmesan cheese, freshly grated


## Steps
1) Cook the pasta following the package directions then drain well

2) Meanwhile the water is heating to a boil...

3) Heat the oil in a skillet for saute pan over medium-low heat then add the garlic and cook for ~2mins

4) Add the tomatoes and pepper and heat through, stirring constantly (2-3 mins)

5) Add the mushrooms and basil**

6) Divide the pasta into bowls then sprinkle with cheese and top with tomato sauce

7) Serve hot with rest of the cheese


## Notes
** The basil can also be added when the pasta is served, usually after the cheese and before the tomato sauce
