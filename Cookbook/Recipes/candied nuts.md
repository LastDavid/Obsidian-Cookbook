Don’t you just love the smell of the candied nuts at the mall or a fair? These make the perfect “hostess gift” for that holiday party. Nobody will believe you did it yourself.

Servings: 10

## Ingredients
- [ ] 1 pound raw nuts (almonds, pecans or walnuts)- [ ] 1 egg white- [ ] 1 teaspoon vanilla- [ ] 1 tablespoon water- [ ] 3/4 cup sugar- [ ] 1 teaspoon cinnamon- [ ] 1/2 teaspoon salt

## Steps
1) Preheat oven to 250. Prep a large baking pan with a large sheet of parchment paper that overhangs all edges of the pan.

2) Mix 3/4 cup sugar (white or a combination white and brown) with 1 t cinnamon and 1/2 t salt. Mix well.

3) One egg white in a mixing bowl, add 1 t vanilla and 1 T water. Whip with a whisk until foamy. About 1 minute.4

4) Add one pound of raw nuts and mix until nuts are coated. I used almonds, but pecans or walnuts would be great also.

5) Add the sugar mixture to the nuts and mix to coat.

6) Pour the nuts onto the parchment paper covered pan and spread into a single layer.

7) Place in the 250-degree oven. About every 15 minutes flip and stir the nuts and then flatten into a single layer again. Total cooking time 1 hour. Remove from oven and allow the nuts to cool on the parchment paper.
