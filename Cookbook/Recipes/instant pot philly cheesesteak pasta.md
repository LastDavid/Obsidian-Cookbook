Servings: 8

## Ingredients
- [ ] 1 tablespoon olive oil- [ ] 1 pound lean ground beef (I used 93% lean)- [ ] 1 teaspoon salt- [ ] 1 large yellow onion, diced- [ ] 2 small green bell peppers, diced- [ ] 3 tablespoons Italian seasoning (I used McCormick "Perfect Pinch Italian Seasoning")- [ ] 2 teaspoons garlic powder- [ ] 1 teaspoon onion powder- [ ] 4 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce- [ ] 1 teaspoon black pepper- [ ] 3 cups beef stock- [ ] 8 ounces macaroni pasta (I used large elbows)- [ ] 10 ounces Provolone Cheese Slices, chopped (more cheese if you’d like)- [ ] 1 tablespoon parsley for garnish if desired.

## Steps
1) I used a 6 quart Instant Pot for this recipe. Set the Instant Pot to saute “more” for high and add the olive oil.

2) Add the ground beef and season with the teaspoon of salt. Cook for about 4-5 minutes, breaking up the meat.

3) Add the onions and peppers then cook for another 3 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent them from sticking to the bottom of the pot.

4) Add the Italian seasoning, garlic powder, onion powder, Worcestershire sauce, and pepper. Cook for 2 more minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent anything from sticking to the bottom of the pot (stirring will reduce the chances of getting the burn notice during pressure cooking).

5) Pour in 1 cup of the beef broth and scrape the bottom of the pot to release the cooked pieces of beef and veggies that have stuck to the bottom. (This will prevent the burn notice from turning on while pressure cooking.)

6) Add the rest of the broth, then sprinkle the macaroni into the sauce evenly. Be sure the pasta is completely submerged in the broth.

7) Lock the lid, seal the valve, and set the pressure cook for 3 minutes (2 minutes for less cooked pasta). It will take 9-10 minutes for the IP to come to pressure.

8) Once the 3 minutes are up, (carefully) manually release the pressure. This will take 3-4 minutes to release

9) Add the cheese and gently mix into the pasta until well combined.

10) Garnish with chopped parsley.
