Servings: 10

## Ingredients

## Steps
1) Pat dry the pork and the coat with about two tablespoons good quality liquid smoke.

3) Make 6 or 8 2" foil balls then squish down to about 1" and place in the bottom of the crock pot

4) Place on the foil balls and cook on low undisturbed for 9-10 hours.

5) Bake until internal temp of 190 plus. About 9-10 hours may vary some with the thickness of the meat and the crock pot.

6) Remove from crock pot onto a large sheet of heavy duty foil. Wrap tight with the foil then wrap with several towels. Allow to rest for at least 15 minutes but 1-2 hours is fine.
