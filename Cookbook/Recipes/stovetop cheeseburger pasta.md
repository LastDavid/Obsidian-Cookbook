Servings: 8

## Ingredients
- [ ] 1 package (16 ounces) penne pasta- [ ] 1 pound ground beef- [ ] 1/4 cup butter, cubed- [ ] 1/2 cup all-purpose flour- [ ] 2 cups 2% milk- [ ] 1-1/4 cups beef broth- [ ] 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce- [ ] 3 teaspoons ground mustard- [ ] 2 cans (14-1/2 ounces each) diced tomatoes, drained- [ ] 4 green onions, chopped- [ ] 3 cups shredded Colby-Monterey Jack cheese, divided- [ ] 2/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided

## Steps
1) Cook pasta according to package directions; drain.

2) Meanwhile, in a Dutch oven, cook and crumble beef over medium heat until no longer pink, 5-7 minutes. Remove from pan with a slotted spoon; pour off drippings.

3) In same pan, melt butter over low heat; stir in flour until smooth. Cook and stir until lightly browned, 2-3 minutes (do not burn). Gradually whisk in milk, broth, Worcestershire sauce and mustard. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly; cook and stir until thickened, 1-2 minutes. Stir in tomatoes; return to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, covered, 5 minutes.

4) Stir in green onions, pasta and beef; heat through. Stir in half of the cheeses until melted. Sprinkle with remaining cheese; remove from heat. Let stand, covered, until melted.


## Notes
For fun crunch and color, top with shredded iceberg lettuce just before serving. Feeling adventurous? Try topping with sliced pickles, too!

The Parmesan cheese seems a little out of character for a cheeseburger pasta, but, trust us, it adds a perfect punch of salty flavor.
