## Ingredients
- [ ] 4 Cornish game hens- [ ] salt and pepper to taste- [ ] 1 lemon, quartered- [ ] 4 sprigs fresh rosemary- [ ] 3 tablespoons olive oil- [ ] 24 cloves garlic- [ ] 1/3 cup white wine- [ ] 1/3 cup low-sodium chicken broth- [ ] 4 sprigs fresh rosemary, for garnish

## Steps
1) Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).

2) Rub hens with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil. Lightly season hens with salt and pepper. Place 1 lemon wedge and 1 sprig rosemary in cavity of each hen. Arrange in a large, heavy roasting pan, and arrange garlic cloves around hens. Roast in preheated oven for 25 minutes.

3) Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a mixing bowl, whisk together wine, chicken broth, and remaining 2 tablespoons of oil; pour over hens. Continue roasting about 25 minutes longer, or until hens are golden brown and juices run clear. Baste with pan juices every 10 minutes.

4) Transfer hens to a platter, pouring any cavity juices into the roasting pan. Tent hens with aluminum foil to keep warm. Transfer pan juices and garlic cloves to a medium saucepan and boil until liquids reduce to a sauce consistency, about 6 minutes. Cut hens in half lengthwise and arrange on plates. Spoon sauce and garlic around hens. Garnish with rosemary sprigs, and serve.


## Notes
Aluminum foil helps keep food moist, ensures it cooks evenly, keeps leftovers fresh, and makes clean-up easy.
