## Steps
1) Heat oven to 375°F. Spray 15x10x1-inch pan with cooking spray. In small bowl, mix ricotta cheese, 3/4 cup Parmesan cheese and 1 tablespoon Italian seasoning. Set aside.

2) Spread 1 1/2 cups of the pasta sauce in pan; top with 4 lasagna sheets. Drop by spoonfuls half of the ricotta cheese mixture over lasagna sheets and sauce (about 1 cup). Sprinkle 1 cup of the mozzarella cheese on top. Evenly spoon 1 1/2 cups of the pasta sauce on top of mozzarella cheese. Layer with remaining 4 lasagna sheets, ricotta mixture and mozzarella cheese. Spoon remaining 1 cup pasta sauce over top. Spray foil with cooking spray; place sprayed side down over pan.

3) Bake 25 minutes. Remove from oven; uncover, and discard foil. Separate dough into 8 triangles. Arrange triangles over lasagna, alternating triangles to fit in pan but allowing a little space between triangles. In small bowl, mix melted butter and garlic powder. Brush over tops of crescents. Sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon Italian seasoning and 1 tablespoon Parmesan cheese over tops. Bake 16 to 20 minutes or until crescents are deep golden brown. Let stand 10 minutes before serving.
