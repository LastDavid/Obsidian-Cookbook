## Ingredients
- [ ] 1 lb bulk hot Italian sausage- [ ] 2 medium red, yellow or green bell peppers, cut into 3/4-inch pieces (2 cups)- [ ] 1/2 cup chopped onion- [ ] 2 cloves garlic, chopped- [ ] 1 can (14.5 oz) Muir Glen™ organic diced tomatoes with Italian herbs- [ ] 1 bag (10 oz) frozen cooked white rice- [ ] 2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese (8 oz)

## Steps
1) Heat oven to 375°F. In 12-inch skillet, cook sausage, bell peppers, onion and garlic over medium-high heat 8 to 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until sausage is no longer pink; drain. Return sausage mixture to skillet. Stir in tomatoes, rice and 1 cup of the cheese.

2) Pour sausage mixture into ungreased 13x9-inch (3-quart) glass baking dish. Cover with foil.

3) Bake 15 to 20 minutes or until cheese is melted. Uncover and sprinkle with remaining 1 cup cheese; bake uncovered 4 to 6 minutes or until cheese is melted.

Frozen precooked rice is available in the freezer section of your grocery store. Brown rice works perfectly, also.
