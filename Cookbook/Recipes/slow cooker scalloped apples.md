Servings: 6

## Ingredients
- [ ] 6-8 medium-sized apples (I used a combination of granny smith and red delicious)- [ ] ½ cup butter- [ ] ½ brown sugar- [ ] ½ tsp. ground cinnamon- [ ] ¼ tsp. ground nutmeg- [ ] ⅛ tsp salt- [ ] 1 tsp. orange zest- [ ] ½ cup chopped walnuts- [ ] Slow Cooker Size:- [ ] 4-quart or larger (I prefer to use an oval slow cooker for this, but a round one will do fine)

## Steps
1) Slice and core the apples. I do not have an apple corer, I sliced the apples first then used a round measuring spoon to cut a circle out of the middle of each apple slice.

2) Arrange the apples in a circular design in the slow cooker.

3) In a small pan over on the stove top set to medium high heat, melt the butter.

4) Add the brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, salt, and orange zest. Stir until a sauce forms for about 2 minutes. It's ok if the brown sugar doesn't completely dissolve, the slow cooker will finish that off.

5) Pour the butter mixture over the apples evenly.

6) Sprinkle over the walnuts.

7) Cover and cook on HIGH for 2.5 hours.

8) Serve warm with ice cream and drizzle the sweet buttery sauce over the apples and ice cream.

9) Enjoy!
