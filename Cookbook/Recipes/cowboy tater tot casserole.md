Servings: 6 serving(s)

## Ingredients
- [ ] 4 strips of bacon (about 3 oz.)- [ ] 1/2 yellow onion, chopped- [ ] 2 cloves garlic, chopped- [ ] 1 lb. ground sirloin- [ ] 1 10.75 oz can cream of mushroom soup- [ ] 3/4 c. milk- [ ] 1/2 tsp. salt- [ ] 3/4 tsp. ground black pepper, divided- [ ] 1 c. frozen corn- [ ] 8 oz. shredded cheddar or Colby jack cheese- [ ] 1 32 oz bag of tater tots- [ ] 1/4 c. grated parmesan cheese- [ ] Chopped chives or scallions, for garnish

## Steps
1) Heat the oven to 375 degrees.

2) Remove the tater tots from the freezer to let them thaw slightly while you prepare the filling.

3) Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add the bacon and cook until golden brown and extra crispy, 6-8 minutes. Remove to a paper towel lined plate and leave the grease in the skillet. Set all of the bacon aside for topping later.

4) Add the onion to the skillet and cook until slightly softened, about 4 minutes.

5) Add the garlic and cook 1 more minute.

6) Add the ground beef and break into small pieces with a wooden spoon. Cook the meat until no pink pieces remain, 6-8 minutes. Drain off excess fat or liquid, if you like. Remove skillet from the heat. Stir in the soup, milk, salt and Â½ teaspoon black pepper and mix until smooth. Fold in corn.

7) Sprinkle the cheddar cheese evenly over the top of the casserole.

8) Place the tater tots on top in a single layer, arranging them in concentric circles (or just toss them on and push them very close together.)

9) Sprinkle the top with parmesan cheese and the additional 1/4 teaspoon of black pepper.

10) Bake 30-35 minutes until the tater tots are golden.

11) Remove from the oven and crumble the cooked bacon over top.

12) Let rest 5 minutes. Top with chopped chives or scallions and serve.
