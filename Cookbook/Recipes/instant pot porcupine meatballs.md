Servings: 12 meatballs

## Ingredients
- [ ] 2 tablespoons olive or vegetable oil- [ ] 1 medium yellow onion, chopped (reserve half)- [ ] 2 cloves garlic, minced (reserve half)- [ ] 1( 15- ounce) can tomato sauce- [ ] 1/2 cup water- [ ] 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce- [ ] 1 pound ground beef (85% lean)- [ ] 1/2 cup uncooked long grain rice- [ ] 1 teaspoon salt- [ ] 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper

## Steps
Sauté the onion and garlic:

1) Select the “Sauté” program on your pressure cooker and add the oil to the pot. (If you are using a stovetop pressure cooker, heat the oil over medium heat.) Add half of the chopped onions and garlic. Sauté until the onions are softened and translucent, about five minutes.

Make the tomato sauce:

1) Stir in the tomato sauce, Worcestershire sauce, and water. Let this warm until it comes to a simmer.

Make the meatballs:

1) While tomato sauce is coming up to a simmer, make the meatballs. In a mixing bowl, combine the beef, rice, salt, pepper, and the rest of the chopped onions and garlic. Roll into ping-pong ball-sized meatballs (1 1/2 inches or so).

Cook the meatballs:

1) Gently place the meatballs in to the pot a single layer. Spoon a little bit of sauce over the top of each one.

Place the lid on the pressure cooker. Make sure the pressure regulator is set to the “Sealing” position. Select the “Manual” program, then set the time to 15 minutes at high pressure. (For stovetop pressure cookers, cook at high pressure for 12 minutes.)

It will take about 10 minutes for your pressure cooker to come up to pressure, and then the actual cooking will begin. Total time from the time you seal the pressure cooker to the finished dish is about 25 minutes.

To serve:

1) You can either perform a quick pressure release by moving the vent from “Sealing” to “Venting,” or you can let the pot depressurize naturally (this takes about 20 minutes), then open it when you’re ready to serve the meatballs. (For stovetop pressure cookers, perform a quick pressure release.)
