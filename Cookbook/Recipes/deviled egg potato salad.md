Servings: 8plus

## Ingredients
- [ ] 6 cups (966g) potatoes- [ ] 6 hard boiled eggs- [ ] 3/4 cup (189g) plain mayonnaise- [ ] 1/2 tsp coarsely ground black pepper- [ ] 1/2 tsp salt- [ ] 1/2 tsp turmeric- [ ] 2 tbsp (30g) yellow mustard- [ ] 1 tbsp honey

## Steps
1) Cook the potatoes in salted water and let them cool completely, or at least until they are cool enough to handle. Chop them into small chinks or about a half inch dice.

2) Hard boil the eggs for about 10-12 minutes. Drain off the boiling water, cover the eggs in cold water and let them cool for 10-15 minutes before peeling off the shells and cutting the eggs in half to remove the yolks to a small bowl. Chop the egg whites into small pieces and add to the chopped potatoes.

3) Add about a tbsp of the mayo to the egg yolks and mash with a fork until the yolks and mayo form a smooth paste.

4) Add the mashed egg yolks to the chopped potatoes along with all of the remaining ingredients.

5) Toss together well until all of the potatoes are evenly coated in the dressing that forms.

6) Cover and chill the potato salad for several hours or overnight before serving.
