# Boneless Country Style Ribs

[Original Recipe](https://www.westviamidwest.com/boneless-country-style-pork-ribs)

![[boneless_country_style_ribs.jpg]]
Servings: 4

## Ingredients
- [ ] 3 pounds boneless pork ribs
- [ ] 1/4 cup BASIC PORK SEASONING: DRY RUB
- [ ] 1/2 cup barbecue sauce


## Steps
1) Preheat oven to 300Â°

2) Remove pork ribs from package and pat dry.  Place into a baking dish or foil lined baking tray.  Gently rub the dry rub on all sides of the ribs.  Making sure all edges are covered.

3) Cover in foil. Place in the oven for 2-2 1/2 hours until you cut into them and they are easily pulled apart with your fork. (fork tender)

4) Remove from the oven paying special attention to not burn yourself when the steam comes rushing out.  Drain away the juices/fat that has come out during cooking.

5) Brush with BBQ sauce. Place back in the oven, uncovered, bake for 30-45 minutes or until the ribs basically disintegrate when you use your fork to cut them and the sauce is bubbly and hot.

6) Serve.  If you make them ahead, you can store them in an airtight container and then rewarm them in the oven until hot.


## Notes
These boneless ribs are very meaty.  Figure on 2-3  ribs per person for the main course.
