## Steps
Preheat the oven and the prepare pans:

1) Place the oven rack in the center and preheat the oven to 350Â° F. Butter and flour three 9-inch round cake pans.

Whisk together the dry ingredients:

1) In a large bowl, vigorously whisk together the dry ingredients: flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg.

Whisk the wet ingredients:

1) In a separate bowl, whisk the canola oil, sugar, and eggs together until combined. Stir the pineapple, bananas, vanilla and one cup of the chopped pecans into the egg mixture and mix (do not beat).

Mix the batter:

1) Using a wooden spoon or spatula, fold the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients until just combined (do not over-mix).

Pour the batter into the pans and bake:

1) Pour the batter into the three prepared cake pans, taking care to divide evenly. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until a toothpick or skewer inserted in the center comes out clean.

Cool the cakes:

1) Cool the cakes in the pans on wire racks for 10 minutes. After 10 minutes, run a knife around the edges and remove the cakes from the pans. Cool completely on wire racks before frosting.

Make the frosting:

1) Beat the softened butter and cream cheese in a large bowl with an electric mixer. With the mixer on low speed, add the powdered sugar in small amounts until all is incorporated, then add the Cointreau and vanilla and beat until the frosting is light and fluffy.

Frost the cooled cake layers:

1) Place one layer, top down, on a large plate or cake stand (this creates a smooth surface on the top and results in a more level cake). Spread frosting evenly over the first layer, then repeat with the second and third layers, then frost the sides.

Top the cake with pecans:

1) Sprinkle the top completely with the remaining cup of chopped pecans (toasted or un-toasted). Alternatively, press the chopped pecans onto the sides of the cake and leave the top simply frosted.


## Notes
The cream cheese frosting recipe can be cut in half if you prefer less frosting. If so, apply sparingly so there is enough to cover the entire cake.

Feel free to use any favorite liquor, such as Grand Marnier, Triple Sec, Cognac, Armagnac, Brandy or even Bourbon. Or, simply omit the liquor and use 2 teaspoons vanilla extract.
