Fresh strawberry pie is a wonderful summer treat. A simple killer recipe everybody will love. Plus almost any fool including me can pull this off.

Servings: 1 pie

## Ingredients
- [ ] 1 pie crust I used Pillsbury- [ ] 1 pound strawberries- [ ] 3 oz strawberry jello one package- [ ] 1/4 cup corn starch- [ ] 1 cup sugar- [ ] 1 1/2 cup water

## Steps
1) Start with a pre-baked pie crust. I did a Pillsbury refrigerated one. Just follow the instructions on the package.

2) Clean and slice up one pound of strawberries. Set them aside and let them air dry while you make the glaze.

3) In a larger sauce pan, add 1 cup sugar to 1 1/2 cups water over medium heat. Sprinkle in 1/4 cup cornstarch slowly while stirring. The mixture will turn cloudy. Stir continuously over medium heat and in 4-5 minutes it will turn clear and thicken. When the thickening is complete (about 30 seconds after it started to clear) remove from heat.

4) Add 3oz package of Strawberry Jello to the mixture and stir completely dissolved. Allow the mixture to cool to room temperature (about 30 minutes).

5) The stir in the berries. Add the berry mixture to the pie crust.

6) Refrigerate for at least 2 hours (3 plus is better) before cutting. Keep refrigerated between servings. This is great the first day and second day. By the third day, the berries deteriorate some.
