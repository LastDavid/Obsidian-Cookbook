Homemade enchilada sauce, fresh chicken and 60 minutes equal great healthier Mexican with this "from scratch" easy recipe. No pre-cooked chicken or can of enchilada sauce needed.

Servings: 6

## Ingredients
- [ ] 2 skinless boneless chicken breasts- [ ] 15 oz tomato sauce- [ ] 1 tablespoon chili powder- [ ] 1 teaspoon paprika- [ ] 1 teaspoon onion powder- [ ] 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder- [ ] 1/2 teaspoon cumin- [ ] 1 teaspoon salt- [ ] 1/2 teaspoon pepper- [ ] 6 corn tortillas 6 inch- [ ] 2 cups lower fat cheese

## Steps
1) Start by preheating oven to 350 convection or 375 conventional.

2) Trim two skinless boneless chicken breast and cut into three pieces each. These vary a lot in size. Aim for about 1 1/2 pound but anywhere from 1 to 2 pounds total should be fine.

3) In a medium sauce pan add one 15 oz. can tomato sauce, one tablespoon chili powder, one teaspoon paprika, one teaspoon onion powder, 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder, 1/2 teaspoon cumin, one teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Mix well.

4) Add the chicken and bring to boil over medium-high heat. Cover and decrease to simmer for 20 minutes.

5) Check the temperature of chicken to be sure it is 165 or more. Remove to cutting board and shred. Divide into three equal piles.

6) Prep an approximately 10X7 baking pan with PAM. Spoon two tablespoons of the sauce over the bottom of the baking pan.

7) Layer two 6 inch corn tortillas over the sauce. Add 1/3 of chicken. Then 1/3 of the sauce (about 2/3 cup). Then 2/3 cup cheese. Repeat this layering twice more.

8) Bake until a golden brown top. About 20 minutes for me.
