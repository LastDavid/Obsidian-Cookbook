Servings: 6

## Ingredients
- [ ] 1# diced rotisserie chicken- [ ] 2 1/2 cups chicken broth- [ ] 1 Tablespoon olive oil- [ ] 1 1/4 cups white long grain rice, uncooked (241g)- [ ] 2 cups fresh broccoli florets, uncooked (250g)- [ ] 10.5 oz. Condensed Cream of Chicken Soup- [ ] ½ cup milk- [ ] ½ cup sour cream- [ ] 2 cups shredded cheddar cheese, separated- [ ] Seasonings- [ ] 1 teaspoon dried thyme- [ ] 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder- [ ] Casserole Topping- [ ] 1 cup Ritz crackers, crushed- [ ] 2 Tablespoons melted butter

## Steps
1) Add the chicken broth, olive oil, and rice to the pot and bring to a boil, then reduce heat to a simmer.

2) Cover tightly and cook for 7 minutes. Refrain from stirring.

3) Turn off the heat and leave the cover on. Let the rice stand for 10 minutes, do not stir. Any rice on the bottom of the pot will release. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

4) Add the cooked chicken, broccoli, soup, milk, sour cream, seasonings, and half of the cheddar cheese.

5) Add to a lightly greased 9 x 13 casserole dish and top with remaining cheese.

6) Cover and bake for 15 minutes.

Add the Topping:

1) Melt the butter and crumble up the crackers. Combine to form the topping for the casserole.

2) Top the casserole with the crumbled cracker topping and bake uncovered for 10 additional minutes.

3) Let the casserole sit for 5 minutes prior to serving.


## Notes
Pro Tips:

Using Frozen Broccoli: 2 cups of frozen broccoli (and/or cauliflower) is a perfect alternative to fresh broccoli. Just be sure you thaw and pat it dry. Frozen broccoli is already blanched (partially cooked), but you may want to consider steaming it as well (about 5 minutes or so) for a softer texture in the casserole.

Heluva Good Cheddar Cheese is my brand of choice for this recipe, it's creamy and melts really well. Avoid extra sharp or aged cheeses as they won't melt as well.
