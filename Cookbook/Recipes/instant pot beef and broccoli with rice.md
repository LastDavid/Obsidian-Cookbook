## Ingredients
- [ ] 1 tbsp olive oil- [ ] 1 lb stir-fry steak strips- [ ] 4 cloves garlic minced- [ ] 1 tbsp fresh ginger, grated- [ ] 1/4 cup reduced sodium soy sauce- [ ] 1/4 cup hoisin sauce- [ ] 1 1/2 cups water- [ ] 1 cup jasmine rice- [ ] 1 head Broccoli- [ ] 1 red pepper, diced- [ ] Sesame seeds for garnish

## Steps
1) Add olive oil, steak strips, garlic, ginger, soy sauce, hoisin sauce, water and rice to Instant Pot in that order. Cook on high pressure for 4 minutes. Instant Pot will take about 10-15 minutes to come to pressure, then pressure cook the 4 minutes so overall cooking time is closer to 20 minutes. Do a quick release of the pressure and open the lid when it's safe to do so.

2) Add in broccoli and red pepper, stirring to combine well. Place lid back on Instant Pot and let sit for 5-10 minutes to let the vegetables steam. Serve with a bit of sesame seeds on top and enjoy!
