tags: Beef, Pasta

Servings: READY IN: 3hrs 20mins SERVES: 10

## Ingredients
- [ ] 1 lb ground beef- [ ] 2 eggs- [ ] 1 ⁄4 cup milk- [ ] 1 ⁄2 cup breadcrumbs- [ ] 1 ⁄2 teaspoon salt- [ ] 1 tablespoon fresh parsley- [ ] 1 teaspoon garlic powder- [ ] 1 ⁄2 teaspoon fresh ground pepper- [ ] 1 ⁄2 cup grated locatelli cheese

## Steps
1) Mix all ingredients in a large bowl by hand.

2) Use your bare hands for best results.

3) Roll meatballs to about the size of a golf ball. (wet your hands to prevent the meat from sticking to them while rolling the meat balls).

4) Drop raw meatballs into large (I use a stock pot) pot of sauce.

5) (I have an incredible sauce recipe {#92096} I use for my meatballs).

6) Simmer for about 3 hours.
