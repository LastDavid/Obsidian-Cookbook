Kid friendly healthier baked chicken nugget for lunch time or a weeknight meal. No mystery ingredient to go into the kiddies with these.

Servings: 16 servings 10 minutes

## Ingredients
- [ ] 2 skinless boneless chicken breasts trimmed- [ ] 2 egg whites or 1 whole egg- [ ] 8 tablespoons bread crumbs any combination of Panko or regular - flavored or not- [ ] 2 tablespoons Parmesan cheese grated- [ ] salt and pepper to taste

## Steps
1) Preheat oven to 375 convection (400 regular).

2) Prep a baking tray. I always line with foil for clean-up. A rack will make the nuggets crispy all around. And then a good spray of PAM.

3) Pat dry and trim two medium skinless boneless chicken breast (about 1 pound). Cut the breasts into nuggets about 1 1/2 inches each. I got 6-7 nuggets out of each breast

4) Whip two egg whites or one egg in a shallow pan or bowl.

5) In a second shallow pan, mix 8 T total of bread crumbs with 2 T grated Parmesan cheese. Salt and pepper to taste. I used 1/2 t salt and 1/4 t pepper.

6) Breadcrumb note: use what you have but 1/4 to 1/2 being Panko will add some texture and crispy taste.

7) Put the chicken in the egg mixture and stir to coat.

8) Move the nuggets individually to the bread crumb mixture and coat well and place on the rack. You could use a large baggie here and shake them in the bread crumbs instead.

9) Give them a light spray of PAM to prevent them from drying too much in the oven.

10) Bake until golden brown and the thickest is 165 temp about 15 minutes.
