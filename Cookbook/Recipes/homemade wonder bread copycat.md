Servings: 16

## Ingredients
- [ ] For the Tangzhong/Roux:- [ ] 1 1/2 ounces (1/3 cup) all purpose flour- [ ] 6 ounces (3/4 cup) milk, whole or low fat- [ ] For the Final Dough:- [ ] 15 ounces (3 1/3 cups) bleached all purpose flour- [ ] 2 ounces (1/4 cup) granulated sugar- [ ] 1 1/2 ounces (1/3 cup) malted milk powder- [ ] 2 teaspoons instant yeast- [ ] 1 1/2 teaspoons Diamond Crystal salt, or 3/4 teaspoon table salt- [ ] 6 ounces (3/4 cup) whole milk- [ ] 1 1/2 ounces (1/4 cup) room temperature coconut oil

## Steps
To make the tangzhong/roux:

1) Whisk together the flour and water in a small saucepan and cook over medium heat, whisking constantly, until you have a thick pudding-like paste, about 2 minutes.

2) Set aside to cool.

To Make the Bread:

1) Sift the flour into the bowl of a stand mixer. Add the sugar, malted milk powder, yeast, salt, milk, coconut oil, and the tangzhong.

2) Knead on low speed for about 12 minutes. The dough should pass the windowpane test.

3) Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm spot until fuffy, about 30 to 45 minutes.

4) Press the dough with your fingertip. If it stays indented, your dough is ready.

5) Heat your oven to 350 degrees F. Oil an 8 inch by 5 inch loaf pan.

6) Turn the dough out onto your work surface, pat it into a rectangle, and roll it into a log. Place it seam side down into the pan. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm spot until the dough crowns the pan, about 25 minutes.

7) Bake the loaf for about 45 minutes, until it reaches an internal temperature of 200 degrees F.

8) Turn the bread out onto a wire rack to cool completely.
