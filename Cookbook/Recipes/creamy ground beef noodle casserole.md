"Comfort" is the key word for this creamy ground beef and noodle casserole that makes a memorable meal out of simple ingredients.

Servings: 6

## Ingredients
- [ ] 8 oz uncooked farfalle pasta (about 2 1/2 cups)- [ ] 1 lb ground beef- [ ] 1 can (15 oz) Muir Glen™ organic tomato sauce- [ ] 1/2 teaspoon garlic salt- [ ] 1/4 teaspoon black pepper- [ ] 1 cup sour cream- [ ] 1 cup cottage cheese- [ ] 1/2 cup shredded Parmesan cheese- [ ] 3/4 cup sliced green onions- [ ] 1 1/2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese (12 oz)

## Steps
1) Heat oven to 350°F. Spray 13x9-inch baking dish or 2 1/2 to 3-quart casserole with cooking spray. Cook pasta until al dente, about 11 minutes; drain, and set aside.

2) Meanwhile, in 10-inch nonstick skillet, cook beef over medium-high heat 5 to 7 minutes, stirring frequently, until no longer pink; drain. Stir in tomato sauce, garlic salt and pepper; cover and simmer 2 to 3 minutes or until slightly thickened.

3) In large bowl, mix sour cream, cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese and 1/2 cup of the green onions; stir in cooked pasta.

4) Spoon half of the pasta mixture into baking dish. Top with half of the beef mixture and 3/4 cup of the Cheddar cheese. Repeat with pasta mixture, beef mixture and remaining 3/4 cup Cheddar cheese. Bake uncovered 25 to 30 minutes or until mixture is thoroughly heated and cheese is melted. Top with remaining 1/4 cup green onions, and serve.
