# Slow Cooker Bread

[Original Recipe](https://www.bakedbyanintrovert.com/slow-cooker-bread)

![[slow_cooker_bread.jpg]]
Servings: 10 SERVINGS Prep Time: 15 MINUTES Cook Time: 2 HOURS

## Ingredients
- [ ] 3 1/2 cups (455 g) bread flour- [ ] 2 1/4 teaspoons instant yeast, (1 envelope)- [ ] 1 1/2 teaspoons salt- [ ] 1 1/2 cups (360 ml) warm water, (105-115Â°F)

## Steps
1) In a large bowl, combine the flour, yeast, and salt. Stir with a whisk. Slowly pour in the water. Stir with a wooden spoon until well blended and the dough forms into a ball. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it set on the counter overnight, 8-18 hours.

2) Line the bowl of the 6-quart slow cooker with parchment paper.

3) Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. With well-floured hands, flatten the dough into a 9-inch circle, then fold it over onto itself and shape it into a ball. Place the dough into the prepared slow cooker. Place a double layer of paper towel under the lid to prevent condensation from dripping onto the rolls. Turn the slow cooker on high and cook for 2 hours or until the bread is cooked through.

4) Remove the bread by lifting them out with the parchment paper.

5) The fully cooked bread will have a light, soft crust. If you desire a golden crispy crust, place the bread under the broiler for 5 minutes. Set the bread on a wire rack to cool completely before slicing.


## Notes
Always double check your slow cooker's manufacturer instructions before attempting this recipe. Some models require the pot to be partially filled with liquid to avoid safety or durability problems. Also, never leave the slow cooker unattended.
