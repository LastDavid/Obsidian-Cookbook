## Steps
1) Mix all ingredients in a bowl until well combined.  Store in a sealed container in the cupboards with all of your spices.


## Notes
Lemon zest can be dried overnight.  If you are in a hurry you can dry the zest in a 225Â° oven for 8-10 minutes on a tray lined with foil. It's important that it is completely dry when adding it to the spice mixture so it doesn't cause clumping.
