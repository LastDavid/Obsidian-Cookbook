The best taco meat you will ever eat for tacos and nachos and without opening an envelope of taco mix

Servings: 12

## Ingredients
- [ ] 2 pounds ground beef 85% or better- [ ] 1 onion large diced- [ ] 1 teaspoon vegetable oil- [ ] 2 tablespoons garlic about 6 cloves crushed- [ ] Spices:- [ ] 4 tablespoons chili powder- [ ] 1-2 teaspoon ground cumin- [ ] 1 teaspoon oregano- [ ] 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper- [ ] 1 teaspoon salt- [ ] 1/2 teaspoon black pepper- [ ] Last Step:- [ ] 8 oz tomato sauce- [ ] 2 teaspoon brown sugar- [ ] 1 tablespoon vinegar

## Steps
1) Place oil in a 12-inch pan over medium heat. Chop onion and cook until browning (about 4 minutes). While onion is cooking prep garlic and measure spices. Add garlic and dry spices. Cook one more minute stirring continuously to "bloom" the spices and garlic.

2) Add ground beef, break up and stir in spices. Increase heat to medium-high. Cook until well browned. About 10 minutes.

3) Add tomato sauce, brown sugar, and vinegar. Mix well and simmer for 5 minutes more.


## Notes
This is about a 6/10 spicy when using 2 teaspoons of cumin and 1/2 teaspoon cayenne. Adjust to your taste.

The part about the fat content of the meat is important. An 80% burger has a lot of fat that should be drained and draining here is getting rid of spices and flavor. Use 85% or 90%.

I frequently skip the brown sugar and vinegar, but they add a little more flavor.

Good in the refrigerator for 3-4 days and freezes well.
