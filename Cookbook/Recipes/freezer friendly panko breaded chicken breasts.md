Servings: 4-6

## Ingredients
- [ ] 1 cup panko bread crumbs- [ ] 1/3 cup grated parmesan cheese- [ ] 1 tsp dried Itialian seasoning- [ ] 1 tsp garlic powder- [ ] 1/2 tsp salt- [ ] 1/2 tsp pepper- [ ] 2 eggs, lightly beaten- [ ] 1/2 cup flour- [ ] 4-6 boneless, skinless chicken breasts- [ ] 3 tbsp olive oil

## Steps
1) Combine first 4 ingredients in a shallow dish (disposable, styrofome plates work great for this).

2) Put the flour and the eggs each in the same type of dish as the bread crumbs.

3) Put the chicken breasts, one at a time into a Ziploc plastic bag.

4) Then taking either the smooth end of meat mallet or a flat bottomed pan, gently pound each chicken breast until it is about 1 inch thick.

5) Take each piece of chicken and coat it with the flour, dip it into the egg and then coat it with bread crumb mixture.

6) Heat oil in a large non-stick skillet over medium to medium high heat (to speed things up, I heat up two pans when Iâ€™m making a big batch, adding 3 tbsp olive oil to each pan).

7) When oil is hot, add chicken to pan and cook 5-6 minutes on each side, until cooked through.


## Notes
To freeze, place cooked chicken breasts on a cookie sheet and freeze. Once chicken is frozen, transfer to zip-loc bags.

To reheat frozen chicken, bake at 350 degrees for 30 minutes.
