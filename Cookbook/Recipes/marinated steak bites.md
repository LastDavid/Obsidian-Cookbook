Servings: 4

## Ingredients
- [ ] 16 ounces top sirloin or ribeye steak cut into 1-inch cubes- [ ] MARINADE:- [ ] 1/2 cup soy sauce- [ ] 1/3 cup olive oil- [ ] 1/8 cup Worcestershire sauce- [ ] 1 teaspoon garlic minced- [ ] 2 tablespoons dried basil- [ ] 1 tablespoon dried parsley- [ ] 1 teaspoon pepper- [ ] 1 teaspoon salt

## Steps
1) Place all ingredients except the steak in a large bowl or ziplock bag. Stir to combine.

2) Drop in steak pieces and seal (or cover bowl) for about 30 minutes. (I like it right at 15 minutes, but you can do as much as overnight)

3) Heat a large skillet to medium-high heat. (You want it hot) Remove steak pieces from marinade and place in hot skillet. Discard remaining marinade.

4) Cook for 1 minute then flip each piece and cook an additional minute. That is for medium steaks, so cook longer if you prefer yours well done.

5) Serve hot.
