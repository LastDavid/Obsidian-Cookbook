Servings: 4

## Ingredients
- [ ] 1 lb boneless skinless chicken breasts, cut in 1-inch pieces- [ ] 1 teaspoon salt- [ ] 3/4 teaspoon poultry seasoning- [ ] 2 tablespoons butter- [ ] 1 1/2 cups Progresso™ chicken broth (from 32-oz carton)- [ ] 2 cups diced peeled russet potatoes- [ ] 1 package (12 oz) frozen mixed vegetables- [ ] 3 tablespoons cornstarch- [ ] 3 tablespoons water- [ ] 1 Pillsbury™ refrigerated pie crust, softened as directed on box

## Steps
1) Heat oven to 450°F. Line large cookie sheet with cooking parchment paper. Spray 6-quart Instant Pot™ insert with cooking spray. In medium bowl, toss chicken pieces with salt and poultry seasoning. Select SAUTE; adjust to normal. Melt butter in insert. Add chicken; cook 3 to 4 minutes without moving, until browned on first side, then turn and cook 2 to 4 minutes or until chicken is browned on second side. Select CANCEL.

2) Stir in broth, potatoes and frozen mixed vegetables. Secure lid; set pressure valve to SEALING. Select MANUAL; cook on high pressure 2 minutes. Select CANCEL. Set pressure valve to VENTING to quick-release pressure.

3) In small bowl, beat cornstarch and water with whisk. Select SAUTE, and adjust to normal; heat liquid to simmering. Beat in cornstarch mixture; cook 30 to 60 seconds, beating frequently with whisk, until thickened. Select CANCEL.

4) Meanwhile, unroll crust on work surface. With 2 1/2-inch round cutter, cut 16 rounds from crust, rerolling once; discard scraps. Place pie crust rounds on cookie sheet. Bake 7 to 9 minutes or until golden brown and crisp. Immediately remove from cookie sheet to cooling rack.

5) Spoon chicken mixture into bowls. Top with pie crust rounds.

For best browning, pat chicken pieces dry before tossing with salt and poultry seasoning.
