An “anyone can do it” recipe that will go with any meal. A skill level of 1/10 but a result level of 10/10. Scale for the amount you need.

Servings: 2 servings

## Ingredients
- [ ] 6 small red potatoes (¾#)- [ ] 1 tbs olive oil- [ ] 1 tbs crushed garlic- [ ] 1 tsp kosher salt

## Steps
1) Start by preheating an oven. I use 400 convection but combine in the oven with other dishes and adjust the cooking time accordingly.

2) Scrub your potatoes and cut into quarters if using small red potatoes. If using bigger potatoes, keep the size about 1 inch or less.

3) In a mixing bowl, combine the potatoes, olive oil, crushed garlic and salt.

4) Spread evenly over a non-stick baking pan. Keep them separated some so they can brown well.

5) Bake for about 30 minutes until nicely browned.
