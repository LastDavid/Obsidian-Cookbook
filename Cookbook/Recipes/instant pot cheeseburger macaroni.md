# Instant Pot Cheeseburger Macaroni

[Original Recipe](https://bykelseysmith.com/instant-pot-cheeseburger-macaroni)

![[instant_pot_cheeseburger_macaroni.jpg]]
## Ingredients
- [ ] 1 lb ground beef- [ ] 1-½ tablespoon paprika- [ ] 1 tablespoon onion powder- [ ] 2 teaspoon garlic powder- [ ] 2 teaspoon mustard powder- [ ] 1-½ teaspoon salt- [ ] 1 teaspoon ground black pepper- [ ] 16 oz elbow macaroni- [ ] 4 cups beef broth- [ ] 2 tablespoon butter- [ ] 2 cups shredded cheddar cheese- [ ] ½ cup heavy whipping cream

## Steps
1) Using the saute setting on the Instant Pot, brown the ground beef. When the ground beef is done cooking, scrape the bottom of the Instant Pot liner to make sure there are no burned bits on the bottom. Drain fat if needed (see notes).

2) Cancel the saute setting. Add the paprika, onion powder, garlic powder, mustard powder, salt, and black pepper to the pot, stirring to coat the ground beef.

3) Add the elbow macaroni, beef broth, butter, submerging the macaroni in broth but do not stir (this could cause a burn error).

4) Close the Instant Pot lid and cook on HIGH pressure for 5 minutes. It will take about 10 minutes to come to pressure before the cook time begins.

5) When the cooking time is complete, follow by a quick release. Stir in the shredded cheddar cheese and heavy whipping until the cheese is melted.
