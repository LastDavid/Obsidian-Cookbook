Servings: 6

## Ingredients
- [ ] 1 pound ground beef (can also use Italian sausage)- [ ] ½ teaspoon garlic powder- [ ] 1 Tablespoon Italian seasoning- [ ] 12 ounces bow tie pasta- [ ] 2 cups beef broth- [ ] 26 ounces spaghetti sauce- [ ] ½ cup sour cream- [ ] ¾ cup shredded Mozzarella cheese- [ ] ½ cup shredded Parmesan cheese optional topping- [ ] Fresh Chopped basil optional topping

## Steps
1) Press the SAUTE button and when it has heated up, add ground beef, garlic powder, and Italian seasoning. Cook until ground beef is no longer pink

2) Drain grease if desired.

3) Dump uncooked bow tie pasta on top of meat and spread evenly.

4) Pour beef broth on top of the pasta, covering as much (if not all) of the pasta as possible.

5) Pour the spaghetti sauce on top of the pasta. Do not mix – just leave as is.

6) Place lid on top of Instant Pot and turn valve to SEALING (not venting).

7) Press MANUAL (or PRESSURE COOK) and set timer for 4 minutes.

8) Once it's done cooking, do a QUICK RELEASE of the pressure (if foam and bubbles start spewing out, move the valve back to venting and wait a minute or two for some of the pressure to die down before opening the valve back up).

9) Remove the lid

10) Stir in the sour cream and mozzarella cheese and mix until sour cream and cheese are completely melted and smooth.

11) Dish and serve topped with Parmesan cheese and fresh basil.


## Notes
PRO TIP: By not mixing the spaghetti sauce into everything else will help avoid getting the burn notice.
