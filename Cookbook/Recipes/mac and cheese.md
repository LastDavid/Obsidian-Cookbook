# Mac and Cheese

Adapted from https://www.thekitchn.com/easy-mac-and-cheese-recipe-257205

Servings: 4 to 8

## Ingredients
- [ ] 6 cups water- [ ] 1 teaspoon kosher salt- [ ] 1 pound dried short pasta, such as macaroni- [ ] 12 ounces shredded melting cheese, such as Fontina, mozzarella, sharp cheddar, Monterey Jack, or Colby- [ ] 4 ounces cream cheese, cut into 4 pieces- [ ] 1/4 cup grated hard cheese, such as Parmesan or Pecorino Romano- [ ] 1/2 teaspoon powdered mustard

## Steps
1) Bring the water and salt to a boil in a large, wide pot (such as a Dutch oven) over medium-high heat. Add the pasta and cook according to package directions, stirring occasionally, until tender. Do not drain the pasta.

2) Reduce the heat to low. Add the shredded cheese, cream cheese, Parmesan, and mustard. Stir until all the cheeses are melted and the sauce is creamy. If the sauce is very thick, add water or milk a few tablespoons at a time until the desired consistency is reached. Taste and season with salt as needed. Serve immediately.


## Notes
Baked mac and cheese: If you have a little extra time, you can bake the macaroni and cheese to give it a golden crust. Pour the prepared mac and cheese into a casserole dish, cover with a lid or foil, and bake at 350Â°F for 30 minutes. Uncover, sprinkle with breadcrumbs and a few pats of butter, and bake uncovered for another 15 to 20 minutes, until the top is golden and the interior is bubbly.

Storage: Leftovers can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week. Reheat in the microwave in 30-second bursts. If the sauce is a little dry after reheating, mix in a splash of milk to make it creamy again.
