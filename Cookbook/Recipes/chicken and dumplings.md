## Ingredients
- [ ] 2 tablespoons butter- [ ] 2 cups chopped yellow onions- [ ] 1 teaspoon poultry seasoning- [ ] 1/2 teaspoon salt- [ ] 1 cup chopped celery- [ ] 1 cup chopped peeled carrots- [ ] 2 cups Progresso™ chicken broth (from 32-oz carton)- [ ] 1 lb boneless skinless chicken breasts, cut in 1-inch pieces- [ ] 1 can (10.2 oz) Pillsbury™ Grands!™ Homestyle refrigerated Buttermilk biscuits (5 biscuits)- [ ] 1/2 cup heavy whipping cream

## Steps
1) On 6-quart Instant Pot™, select SAUTE; adjust to normal. Melt butter in insert. Add onions, poultry seasoning and salt; cook 6 to 8 minutes, stirring occasionally, until softened. Select CANCEL.

2) Stir in celery and carrots. Stir in broth and chicken. Secure lid; set pressure valve to SEALING. Select MANUAL; cook on high pressure 2 minutes. Select CANCEL. Set pressure valve to VENTING to quick-release pressure.

3) Meanwhile, separate dough into 5 biscuits. Cut each biscuit into 8 pieces. Set Instant Pot™ to SAUTE, normal temperature. Stir in whipping cream; heat to simmering. Stir in biscuit pieces; cook 4 to 6 minutes, stirring frequently, until dumplings are cooked through and liquid thickens.

Take care to drop the biscuit pieces into the simmering liquid individually so that they don’t clump together.
