Servings: 12

## Ingredients
- [ ] 12 large eggs- [ ] 6 tablespoons mayonnaise (80g)- [ ] 2 teaspoons yellow mustard (10g)- [ ] 2 teaspoons apple cider vinegar (10g)- [ ] 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt- [ ] Paprika for garnish- [ ] Chives for garnish

## Steps
1) In a large pot, arrange the eggs in one layer. Fill with water until about 1/2-inch above the eggs.

2) Bring the pot to a boil, stirring occasionally to balance the yolks, cover, and remove from the heat. Let sit for 14 minutes. While the eggs are cooking, prepare an ice-water bath in a large bowl. Once the eggs are done, transfer them to the ice water bath using a slotted spoon. Let cool for 1 to 2 minutes.

3) Peel the eggs under water and pat dry with a paper towel. Using a sharp knife, halve the eggs and gently remove the cooked yolks to a medium bowl using a small spoon. Set the egg whites aside.

4) To the yolks, add the mayonnaise, mustard, apple cider vinegar, and salt. Mash the yolks with a fork. Whisk to combine (or use a handheld mixer). Spoon or pipe the yolk mixture into each of the egg white wells. Sprinkle paprika and chives over eggs and serve immediately. If making ahead, keep refrigerated until ready to serve.
