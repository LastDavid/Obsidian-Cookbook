Adapted from https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/239849/loaded-chicken-potato-soup/print/?recipeType=Recipe&servings=8&isMetric=false

## Ingredients
- [ ] 2 1/2 pounds russet potatoes- [ ] 1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, cut into chunks- [ ] 2 tablespoons olive oil, or as needed- [ ] 1 teaspoon salt, plus more to taste- [ ] 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper, plus more to taste- [ ] 1 onion, diced- [ ] 1 cup diced carrots- [ ] 2 stalks celery, diced- [ ] 6 tablespoons butter- [ ] 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour- [ ] 3 cups milk- [ ] 1 cup chicken stock- [ ] 1 cup bite-size broccoli florets- [ ] 1/2 cup bacon bits, divided- [ ] 2 green onions, chopped- [ ] 5 ounces shredded sharp Cheddar cheese, divided- [ ] 1 cup sour cream

## Steps
1) Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).

2) Prick potatoes with a fork and wrap each potato in aluminum foil.

3) Bake in the preheated oven until potatoes are tender, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Cool potatoes until easily handled; scoop insides from skins and discard skins.

4) Place chicken in a bowl and add enough olive oil to coat; add 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper and toss to coat.

5) Heat a skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir chicken until no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, 5 to 10 minutes.

6) Toss onion, carrots, and celery with enough olive oil to coat in a bowl.

7) Heat a skillet over medium-low heat; cook and stir onion mixture until tender, 5 to 10 minutes.

8) Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium-heat. Stir flour into melted butter and cook until lightly browned, 1 to 2 minutes. Pour milk, about 1/4 cup at a time, into butter-flour mixture; cook, stirring constantly, until sauce is thickened, about 10 minutes.

9) Stir cooked potato, chicken, onion mixture, chicken stock, broccoli, 1/2 of the bacon bits, 1/2 of the green onions, and 4 ounces of the Cheddar cheese into the sauce. Cook soup until heated through and broccoli is tender, about 10 minutes; season with salt and pepper. Stir sour cream into soup and cook until heated through, about 5 minutes.

10) Ladle soup into serving bowls and top with remaining bacon, green onions, and Cheddar cheese.
