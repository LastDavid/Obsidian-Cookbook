Servings: 6

## Ingredients
- [ ] Egg Noodles:- [ ] 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour- [ ] 1 pinch salt- [ ] 1 egg , beaten- [ ] 1/4 cup milk- [ ] 1/2 tablespoon butter , softened- [ ] Soup:- [ ] 2 tablespoons butter- [ ] 3/4 cup chopped onion- [ ] 3/4 cup chopped celery- [ ] 1 cup sliced carrots- [ ] 2 garlic cloves , minced- [ ] 9 cups reduced sodium chicken broth (see note)- [ ] 2 cups uncooked egg noodles (store bought or homemade recipe above)- [ ] 1/2 teaspoon dried basil- [ ] 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano- [ ] (optional) dash of poultry seasoning- [ ] salt and pepper to taste- [ ] 2 cups cooked and shredded chicken breasts

## Steps
1) For the noodles: In a large bowl, stir together the flour and salt. Add the beaten egg, milk, and butter. Knead dough until smooth, about 5 minutes. Let rest in a covered bowl for 10 minutes.

2) On a floured surface, roll out to 1/8 or 1/4 inch thickness. Cut into desired lengths and shapes.

3) Separate and allow to air dry before cooking. For best results, let them air dry for a couple of hours but I've been in a rush and only let them dry 30 minutes and they were fine.

4) For the soup: In a large pot over medium heat, melt butter. Cook onion, celery, and carrots in butter until just tender, 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for an additional minute. Pour in chicken broth and stir in noodles, basil, oregano, (optional) poultry seasoning, salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer about 15-20 minutes. Stir in the chicken and cook until heated through. Serve.


## Notes
I really like the Better Than Bouillon Chicken brand for my chicken broth. It's a paste that you add water to.
