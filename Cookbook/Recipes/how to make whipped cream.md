# How to Make Whipped Cream

Adapted from https://www.onceuponachef.com/recipes/whipped-cream.html

Servings: 2 cups

## Ingredients
- [ ] 1 cup cold heavy cream or heavy whipping cream- [ ] 2 tablespoons confectioners' sugar

## Steps
1) If time allows, stick the bowl and whisk in the refrigerator or freezer for 10 to 15 minutes prior to making the whipped cream.

2) In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment (or in a large bowl if using a hand mixer), beat the cream on medium speed (or medium-high if using a hand mixer) until it starts to thicken, about 2 minutes. Add the sugar and continue beating on medium speed until soft peaks form, 1 to 2 minutes more. Keep a close eye on it – it's always done before you think it is, and it goes from perfectly smooth and billowy to grainy and curdled in an instant. It should have a smooth, creamy texture and dollops should just barely hold their shape. If you're nervous about over whipping it, when it's close to done, remove the bowl from the mixer and finish whipping by hand (you don't need to dirty a whisk; simply hold the whisk attachment with your hand). Use immediately or cover with plastic wrap and store in the refrigerator for up to 3 hours. If you don’t plan on serving it immediately, it’s best to under whip it slightly and then whisk it by hand to the desired consistency right before serving. Leftover whipped cream will keep for a few days in the refrigerator but will lose some of its volume. You may need to rewhip for a few seconds before serving.


## Notes
Note: If you accidentally over-whip the cream by a few seconds, you can salvage it by adding a few more tablespoons of cold cream and gently whisking it in by hand until smooth. If it's beyond repair (i.e., it looks like butter), continue whipping until stiff, add a pinch of salt, and spread it on your toast.
