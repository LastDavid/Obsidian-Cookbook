# Pancakes

Adapted from https://www.chefsteps.com/activities/light-fluffy-pancakes

I made this.

Servings: 675 g batter

## Ingredients
- [ ] 200g Pastry flour- [ ] 30g Sugar- [ ] 20g Malted Milk powder- [ ] 12g Baking powder- [ ] 6g Salt- [ ] 240g Whole Milk- [ ] 2 Large Egg- [ ] 60g Butter

## Steps
1) Sift together dry ingredients

2) With a whisk, combine milk and eggs in a large bowl. Gradually add dry mix and keep whisking until your batter just comes together.

3) TIP: Don’t overmix! Too much gluten development will lead to a firmer, tougher pancake. Mix the batter just enough to hydrate the dry ingredients, then stop.

4) Melt butter on the stove over low heat or in the microwave.

5) Pour your melted butter into the batter and stir gently to incorporate.

6) The time has come for you to make some pancakes.

7) We like to start out on medium heat with a dry nonstick pan. Spoon some batter into a small circle, and rotate the spoon to pile the batter into a little mound. Then step back. Don’t move the pancakes around. Just give them time to gently cook through, monitoring your heat so they don’t scorch on the bottom.

8) Once air bubbles begin to form on the top and steam is puffing out, it’s time to flip. If you’ve got fancy flipping skills, this is your time to shine. If you just want to use a spatula, hey, we support you. Just be gentle so you don’t splatter the raw batter when you flip the pancakes.

9) Continue cooking on the other side until you’ve achieved golden-brown perfection.
