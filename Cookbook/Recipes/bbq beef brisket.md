Great Kansas City BBQ Beef Brisket for everybody. The ultimate KISS recipe. This oven-baked BBQ Brisket is melt in your mouth tender with a wonderful smoky taste. With only about 5 minutes total work time, what could be better? A never failed recipe we have used for 40 years.

Servings: 16 servings

## Ingredients
- [ ] 4# Beef Brisket (any size will do)- [ ] 3-4 tbs Liquid smoke- [ ] BBQ sauce

## Steps
1) Oven to 300 degrees, not convection. No need to preheat.

2) Pat dry the brisket. Place in pan fat side up. Cover top of meat with a generous amount of liquid smoke 3-4 tablespoons.

3) Place in oven until "fork tender". About 4-4 1/2 hours. If you don't "get" fork tender that is an internal temperature of 190-195 minimum. (May take over 6-8 hours if frozen or a whole brisket)

4) Scrap off the "fat cap" before removing from pan. If you cooked a whole or point end half, it is a good time to separate the two for cutting later. Place on a platter, cover with foil and refrigerate for a least 3 hours before cutting. Discard liquid.

5) Cut CROSS GRAIN into 1/8 to 1/4 inch slices. Transfer back to a pan. Cover top with BBQ sauce. Seal with aluminum foil again and reheat in oven preheated to 375. About 25 minutes.
