Adapted from https://30seconds.com/food/tip/47367/This-Cheesy-Ground-Beef-Taco-Casserole-Recipe-Is-a-Family-Favorite

Servings: 8

## Ingredients
- [ ] 1 pound lean (at least 80%) ground beef- [ ] 1 cup chopped onions- [ ] 1/4 cup chopped green onions- [ ] 1 package (1 ounce)  taco seasoning mix (I like low-sodium taco seasoning)- [ ] 2/3 cup water- [ ] 1 can (19 ounces)  enchilada sauce- [ ] 1 can (15 ounces)  black beans, drained and rinsed- [ ] 1 can (14 ounces)  whole kernel corn, drained- [ ] 1 bag (9.25 ounces)  corn chips or  tortilla chips (about 5 1/2 cups)- [ ] 2 cups (8 ounces) shredded Mexican cheese blend- [ ] sour cream

## Steps
1) In a nonstick skillet, cook beef and onions over medium-high heat, stirring frequently until brown. Drain. Stir in taco seasoning and water. Heat to boiling then reduce heat to medium. Simmer, uncovered, 3 to 4 minutes or until thickened. Stir in black beans, corn and enchilada sauce. Cook 1 to 2 minutes or until heated through.

2) Place 4 cups of the corn chips in a single layer in a  13x9-inch baking dish that's been sprayed with nonstick cooking spray. Top with 1 cup of shredded cheese. Spoon beef mixture over cheese, then top with remaining 1 cup cheese.

3) Bake in a preheated 350-degree F oven 18 to 20 minutes or until cheese is melted and edges are bubbly. Top with remaining corn chips and the green onions. Serve with sour cream and guacamole.
