Adapted from https://www.pillsbury.com/recipes/slow-cooker-smothered-chicken/c198b55f-9fa5-49c9-871e-eb9da5c2ed7b

Servings: 6

## Ingredients
- [ ] 1 package (20 oz) boneless skinless chicken thighs (about 6)- [ ] 1/4 cup Progresso™ chicken broth (from 32-oz carton)- [ ] 1 container (8 oz) chive & onion cream cheese spread- [ ] 1/4 teaspoon salt- [ ] 1/2 teaspoon pepper- [ ] 1 cup chopped cooked bacon- [ ] 1 cup frozen sweet peas- [ ] Cooked egg noodles, as desired

## Steps
1) Spray bottom of 3- to 4-quart slow cooker with cooking spray. Add chicken thighs to slow cooker.

2) In small microwavable bowl, mix chicken broth, cream cheese spread, salt and pepper. Microwave uncovered on High 1 minute; beat with whisk until smooth. Pour mixture on top of chicken thighs. Cover; cook on Low heat setting 3 to 3 1/2 hours or until juice of chicken is clear when thickest part is cut (at least 165°F).

3) Stir 3/4 cup of the bacon and the frozen sweet peas into chicken mixture; mix well. Increase heat setting to High; cover and cook 10 to 15 minutes or until peas are cooked.

4) Serve chicken and sauce over cooked egg noodles; top with remaining 1/4 cup bacon.


## Notes
For creamy smothered chicken, make sure to use regular cream cheese and not the reduced-fat version.

Garnish with chopped fresh chives, if desired.

This smothered chicken is great served over egg noodles. Plan to cook and drain the egg noodles just before serving.
