# Thanksgiving Turkey

tags: Thanksgiving, Turkey

Fresh or Frozen Whole Turkey

Servings: 2lb per person

## Ingredients
- [ ] 1 Fresh or Frozen Whole Turkey

## Steps
What size:

1) 2lb per person (this will ensure leftovers)

Keep in mind that a turkey only has two Drumsticks. Buy extra if neccessary.

Thawing methods:

1) Slow - Thaw in the Refrigerator

Timeline: Allow approximately 24 hours for every 5 pounds of turkey

Tips: Keep the turkey in its original wrapping while it's thawing.

Place breast-side-up in a baking pan to keep any drips from contaminating other foods and refrigerator surfaces.

You can hold the thawed turkey in the fridge for up to 2 days before cooking.

2) Medium: Thaw in Cold Water

Timeline: Allow approximately 30 minutes for every pound of turkey.

Tips: Keep the turkey in its original wrapping, and place it in a larger, leak-proof plastic bag. Squeeze out extra air and seal the bag.

Place the sealed bag breast-side down in a sink or bucket large enough so the turkey will be completely submerged.

Fill with cold water. You may need to cover the turkey with a plate and place some heavy cans on top of it to keep it totally submerged.

Change the cold water every 30 minutes.

Cook the turkey immediately after thawing.

3) It is also possible to use a combination of the two methods

Use the fridge for the first two days of thawing, and finish in the sink early Thanksgiving morning.

Roasting:

1) Preheat oven to 325° F.

2) Drain juices and pat dry with clean paper towels.

3) Place turkey breast side up on a flat rack in a shallow roasting pan 2 to 2½ inches deep.

4) Turn the wings back to hold the neck skin in place. (Tucking the wings will help stabilize the turkey in the pan and when carving)

5) Brush or spray skin lightly with vegetable or cooking oil for best appearance.

6) Insert an oven-safe meat thermometer deep into the lower part of the thigh without touching the bone.

7) When the thigh is up to temperature, and if the turkey is stuffed, move the thermometer to the center of the stuffing.

8) Place your turkey in the oven.

9) When the turkey is about ⅔ done, loosely cover the breast with a piece of foil to prevent overcooking.

10) Your turkey is done when the temperature with a meat thermometer is 180° F in thigh and 170° F in breast or stuffing.

11) Lift turkey onto platter, and let stand for 15 minutes before carving.

12) Turkey cook-time varies by weight, so there’s also a handy chart to help you plan. Don’t forget the foil tent when you’re ⅔ of the way through cooking to prevent dryness!
