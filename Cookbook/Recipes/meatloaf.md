## Ingredients
- [ ] 2 lbs Ground Beef No less than 80% lean- [ ] 1 small Onion chopped fine- [ ] 2 Eggs- [ ] 1 cup Seasoned Bread Crumbs (60g)- [ ] 8oz can Tomato Sauce divided (130g for meatloaf)- [ ] 1/2 tsp Fresh Ground Pepper- [ ] 1/2 tbsp Garlic Powder- [ ] 1/2 tbsp Onion Powder- [ ] 1 tsp Salt- [ ] 1 tablespoon Worcestershire Sauce- [ ] Sauce:- [ ] Remainder of tomato sauce- [ ] 2 tbsp Brown Sugar- [ ] 2 tsp Yellow Mustard- [ ] 2 tbsp Steak Sauce I use the generic A1 type

## Steps
1) Preheat oven 350 degrees

2) In a large bowl mix all meatloaf ingredients together.

3) Mix all sauce ingredients together in a small bowl and set aside

4) Place meatloaf mixture into 9x5vloaf pan and press into place. I personally like my meatloaf solid so that it doesn't fall apart when I cut it, which is why I press mine pretty tightly into that pan.

5) Spread 1/2 sauce mixture over top of meatloaf

6) Bake at 350 degrees for 1 hour

7) Remove meatloaf from the oven

8) Drain and discard some of the oil (about 1/3 cup)

9) Spread the remaining sauce on top of meat loaf

10) Continue baking for another 30mins

11) Let cool for about 15 minutes (if you can wait) and then enjoy
