This is the best oven fried chicken you will ever make. Get great fried chicken taste with this easy oven recipe.

Servings: 2 servings

## Ingredients
- [ ] 2 skinless boneless chicken breasts- [ ] 2 cups milk- [ ] 4 tbsp butter- [ ] 1 cup AP flour- [ ] 2 tablespoons seasoning salt I used Lowery’s- [ ] 2 teaspoon paprika- [ ] 1 teaspoon black pepper- [ ] For Gravy:- [ ] 1/4 cup AP flour- [ ] 14 oz chicken broth- [ ] salt and pepper to taste

## Steps
1) Start with a milk marinade for 30-60 minutes. Cover the chicken with the milk and allow to set in the refrigerator.

2) Preheat oven to 375 convection or 400 conventional. Mix 1 cup AP flour with 2 tablespoons seasoning salt (I used Lowery’s), two teaspoon paprika, one teaspoon black pepper. Mix well.

3) Slice up four tablespoons of butter into an oven and stove top safe pan. Place in the hot oven for 2-3 minutes to melt the butter.

4) Shake off any extra milk and dip the chicken in the flour mixture. Shake off excess flour and place “good side” down into the melted butter.

5) Bake for 20 minutes then turn chicken over. Cook until internal temperature of 165 (about 15-20 minutes more) depending on the thickness of the chicken.

6) Remove chicken and place pan over medium heat. At this point, you should have some drippings left. You need about 1/4 cup. If you don’t have that, add a little chicken broth. Add flour approximately equal to the volume of the liquid. Whisk the flour and liquid together and cook until browning some. About 2 minutes.

7) Add 1 – 14 oz can of chicken broth, and bring to boil while continuously whisking. Continue until nicely thickened. About 3-4 minutes. Add salt and pepper to taste.


## Notes
Since I'm cooking for two, the one pan thing works well but if you are cooking for more, use a larger pan like a cake pan and you can move the drippings to a sauce pan to make the gravy.

If you have issues with the coating sticking to the chicken, coat the chicken with the flour mixture and allow to rest for 10-15 minutes. Then proceed with melting the butter and cooking.
