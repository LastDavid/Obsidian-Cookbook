# So, What Does Al Dente Mean?

### What is al dente and how do you know when your pasta is ready? We break down what you need to know.
Pasta is certainly a weeknight dinner hero. Quick pasta recipes are easy and inexpensive to throw together so dinner can be ready in a flash. While each pasta shape has a unique cooking time, just about every package instructs you to cook the noodles until they reach the “desired consistency.” For most, that’s al dente. But what is al dente, and how do you know when you’ve reached it?

## What Is Al Dente?
The phrase al dente literally translates from Italian to mean “to the tooth.” It describes the texture of cooked pasta when it’s tender but firm and chewy when you bite into it. If your pasta is mushy and soft, you’ve blasted right past al dente and into well done. This softer pasta is easier to digest, but it contains fewer nutrients (more on that in a moment).

## How Do You Know if Pasta Is Al Dente?
The best way to test if pasta is al dente is to take a bite. About two minutes before the time expires on the package directions, give the pasta a taste. If it’s tender enough to chew but still contains a bit of a bite, you’ve reached al dente. If it’s too firm for your liking, continue cooking it until it reaches the preferred level of doneness.

### Can You Cook Fresh Pasta to Al Dente?
In case you were wondering, it’s not possible to achieve al dente status with fresh pasta or homemade pasta dough. These noodles cook in a matter of minutes—much more quickly than dried pasta—so they never reached that tender-firm stage. Instead, to check for doneness, bite into a noodle and look for a tiny white dot in the center. If you see it, continue cooking until it disappears.

## Why Cook Pasta to Al Dente?
Why do recipes recommend cooking pasta until al dente? The answer is twofold: texture and nutrition. From a texture perspective, al dente pasta is firm and chewy, and it holds its shape whether it’s being tossed in sauce or baked in a casserole. It also contains more starches, which help the sauce cling to the pasta for a better eating experience.

Speaking of starches, al dente pasta is actually more nutrient-dense, too. The starch molecules aren’t fully released into the boiling water, allowing them to be slowly digested by your body. That means al dente pasta has a lower glycemic index than fully cooked pasta, which can prevent a spike in blood sugar.
