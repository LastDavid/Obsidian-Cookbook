Servings: 2 potpies (8 servings each)

## Ingredients
- [ ] 2 cups diced peeled potatoes- [ ] 1-3/4 cups sliced carrots- [ ] 1 cup butter, cubed- [ ] 2/3 cup chopped onion- [ ] 1 cup all-purpose flour- [ ] 1-3/4 teaspoons salt- [ ] 1 teaspoon dried thyme- [ ] 3/4 teaspoon pepper- [ ] 3 cups chicken broth- [ ] 1-1/2 cups whole milk- [ ] 4 cups cubed cooked chicken- [ ] 1 cup frozen peas- [ ] 1 cup frozen corn- [ ] 4 sheets refrigerated pie crust

## Steps
1) Preheat oven to 425째. Place potatoes and carrots in a large saucepan; add water to cover. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cook, covered, 8-10 minutes or until crisp-tender; drain.

2) In a large skillet, heat butter over medium-high heat. Add onion; cook and stir until tender. Stir in flour and seasonings until blended. Gradually stir in broth and milk. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly; cook and stir 2 minutes or until thickened. Stir in chicken, peas, corn and potato mixture; remove from heat.

3) Unroll a pie crust into each of two 9-in. pie plates; trim even with rims. Add chicken mixture. Unroll remaining crusts; place over filling. Trim, seal and flute edges. Cut slits in tops.

4) Bake 35-40 minutes or until crust is lightly browned. Let stand 15 minutes before cutting.

Freeze option: Cover and freeze unbaked pies. To use, remove from freezer 30 minutes before baking (do not thaw). Preheat oven to 425째. Place pies on baking sheets; cover edges loosely with foil. Bake 30 minutes. Reduce oven setting to 350째; bake 70-80 minutes longer or until crust is golden brown and a thermometer inserted in center reads 165째.


## Notes
When the edge of the crust falls inward off the lip of the pie plate, we say it slumped. Reduce slumping by letting a fluted crust rest in the refrigerator 30 to 45 minutes.
