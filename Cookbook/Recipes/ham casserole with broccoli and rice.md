![[ham_casserole_with_broccoli_and_rice.jpg]]
Servings: 6

## Ingredients
- [ ] 2 Tablespoons unsalted butter- [ ] ½ cup yellow onion, finely diced- [ ] 1 Tablespoon olive oil- [ ] 2 1/2 cups chicken broth, low sodium- [ ] 1 ¼ cup white long grain rice, uncooked- [ ] 2 cups cooked ham, diced (16oz)- [ ] 2 cups broccoli florets (180g)- [ ] 10.75 oz. cream of chicken soup- [ ] ½ cup sour cream- [ ] ¾ cup milk- [ ] 2 cups shredded cheddar cheese, separated- [ ] Salt/Pepper, optional- [ ] Ritz Cracker Topping- [ ] 1 cup Ritz Crackers, crushed into crumbs- [ ] 2 Tablespoons butter, melted

## Steps
1) Note: This recipe is designed to allow you to prepare all of the casserole ingredients in one pot before transferring to a casserole dish for baking. Before you begin, refer to your rice package for the amount of liquid (we'll use chicken broth) and cooking time. If preferred, cook the rice separately and skip the broth ingredient. You'll need 2 cups of cooked rice to combine with the other casserole ingredients. I use white long grain rice and the cooking times below work perfectly.

2) Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

3) Melt the 2 Tablespoons butter in a large saucepan over medium heat.

4) Add the diced onions and cook for 5 minutes, until softened.

5) Add the chicken broth, olive oil, and rice to the pot and bring to a boil, then reduce heat to a simmer.

6) Cover tightly and cook for 7 minutes.

7) Add the broccoli, replace the cover, cook for 8 more minutes. Refrain from stirring.

8) Turn off heat, leave the cover on. Let the rice stand for 10 minutes. Any rice on the bottom of the pot will release during this time.

9) Add the diced ham, condensed soup, sour cream, milk, and ONE cup of the cheddar cheese. Stir until well-combined.

10) Spread into a lightly greased 9 x 13 casserole dish.

11) Top with remaining cup of cheddar cheese.

12) Cover and bake for 15 minutes.

13) Combine the Ritz cracker crumbs and butter. Spread over the top of the casserole and bake, uncovered, for 10 additional minutes.

14) Let the casserole sit for 5 minutes prior to serving.


## Notes
Heluva Good Cheese melts nice and creamy. Avoid extra sharp or aged cheeses as they won't melt as well.

Using frozen broccoli instead of fresh:

I love the way this comes out with fresh broccoli, but if necessary, frozen broccoli may be used instead. Be sure to let it thaw and pat it dry prior to adding it to the mixture.

One Pot Method (vs. casserole-style):

Cook the rice for 18 minutes instead of 15.

Add the broccoli to the rice during the last 7 minutes of steaming and close the lid to allow it to cook.

Combine casserole ingredients as instructed, top with cheese. Close the lid to let it melt and serve.
