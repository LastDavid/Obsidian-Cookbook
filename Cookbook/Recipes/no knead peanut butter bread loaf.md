# No-Knead Peanut Butter Bread Loaf

Adapted from https://whattocooktoday.com/no-knead-peanut-butter-bread-loaf.html

Servings: 14 SLICES (8 1/2 X 4 1/2 LOAF)

## Ingredients
- [ ] Dry ingredients:- [ ] 350 gr bread flour- [ ] 40 gr sugar- [ ] ½ tsp salt- [ ] 1 ¾ tsp instant yeast see notes 1- [ ] Wet ingredients:- [ ] 150 gr creamy peanut butter- [ ] 200 gr milk start with this amount and add as needed- [ ] 1 large egg lightly beaten, about 60 grams with the shell- [ ] Topping:- [ ] 40 gr Dry roasted peanuts finely chopped or leave whole

## Steps
Prepare the dough:

1) Combine all the dry ingredients in a large mixing bowl. If using active dry yeast, add it after it has bloomed for 10 minutes with the rest of the ingredients. Add the wet ingredients. As water absorption by flour may vary, I suggest starting with 200 ml of liquid. Use a wooden spatula to stir and combine into a dough that is slightly sticky. If it's too dry, add more water 1 tablespoon at a time. The dough should be slightly sticky to touch

2) Scrape the side of the bowl to gather all the dough into a dough ball. Apply some oil or non-stick spray on the side to prevent sticking

Proof the dough:

1) Cover with a cling wrap and let the dough proof until it doubles in size, about 1-2 hours or longer, depending on the temperature. When you poke the dough with your finger, the indentation stays, which means the 1st proofing is done

2) Prepare the bread loaf pan by applying some oil all over or use a non-stick cooking spray. You can also line with parchment paper at the bottom if you want

3) Punch down the dough to release air and then use a spatula to fold the dough over several times to deflate more air and to smooth the dough

4) Transfer the dough into a working surface. I have sprayed with some non-sticky spray. Flatten the dough and roughly spread it out into a rectangle shape and then roll and tuck. I didn’t do this before but after making this bread several times, this helps to build tension to the dough

5) Transfer into the loaf pan. Then gently press the dough to flatten and to fit into the pan nicely. Spray with some water and add some peanuts by pressing them onto the surface of the dough so they stick and won’t come off after baking

2nd proofing:

1) Cover with a cling wrap or damp towel and put at a warm place to let it proof again. Let the dough proof until it has risen about 1 inch above the rim. 15 minutes before end of proofing, preheat the oven to 350 F (180 C)

Bake the bread:

1) Place the loaf pan in the middle rack and bake for 30-35 minutes or until the top is nicely golden brown. If you have a digital thermometer, the internal temperature should be 200 F (93 C)

Cool down:

1) Let the bread cool in the pan for 2 minutes. Brush the top of the loaf with some melted coconut oil or butter if you want a soft crust. You can opt out as well

2) Transfer the bread to a cooling rack to let it cool down completely before slicing and storing the bread


## Notes
If you use active dry yeast, mix it with 2 Tbsp of warm water (NOT hot) and let it bloom for 10 minutes. It will be bubbly. If not, the yeast may not be active anymore
