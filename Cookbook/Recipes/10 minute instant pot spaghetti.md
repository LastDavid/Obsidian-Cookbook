Servings: 6

## Ingredients
- [ ] 1 tablespoon olive oil
- [ ] 1 pound ground beef
- [ ] 1 tablespoon Italian seasoning
- [ ] 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- [ ] 1/2 teaspoon salt
- [ ] 1/4 teaspoon pepper
- [ ] 1 pound spaghetti noodles
- [ ] 2 24 ounce jars marinara sauce
- [ ] 3 cups water


## Steps
1) Set a 6 quart instant pot to saute. Add the olive oil, ground beef, Italian seasoning, garlic powder, salt and pepper. Cook and crumble until no longer pink.

2) Break the noodles in half. Layer them in a criss cross pattern so they do not stick as it cooks. Pour the marinara and water on top of the noodles.

3) Cook on high pressure for 5-7 minutes. Use the quick release and wait for cycle to complete before unlocking. Stir together and serve with parmesan and chopped basil.
