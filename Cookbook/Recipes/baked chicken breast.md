Servings: 4

## Ingredients
- [ ] 1 tablespoon brown sugar, packed- [ ] 1 1/2 teaspoons paprika- [ ] 1 teaspoon dried oregano, (or thyme, parsley, rosemary)- [ ] 1 teaspoon salt- [ ] 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder- [ ] 1/2 teaspoon onion powder- [ ] 1/4 teaspoon cracked black pepper, to taste- [ ] 1 teaspoon chili powder- [ ] 4 large chicken breasts (~200g each)- [ ] 1 tablespoon olive oil- [ ] OPTIONAL:- [ ] 3 tablespoons butter- [ ] 2 cloves garlic, minced or finely chopped- [ ] 2 teaspoons fresh chopped parsley

## Steps
1) Preheat oven to 425°F or 390°F for convection ovens.

2) Using a meat mallet or rolling pin, pound each chicken breast to 0.8-inch | 2cm at the thickest part. Make sure your fillets are all the same thickness to ensure even cooking.

3) Combine sugar, paprika, oregano, salt, powders, pepper and chili (if using).

4) Line a baking pan with aluminnium foil. Transfer chicken to the pan and toss chicken in the seasoning. Drizzle with the oil and rub seasoning all over to evenly coat.

5) Bake chicken in preheated oven for 16-18 minutes, or until internal temperature is 165°F using a meat thermometer. It should be golden with crisp edges.

6) Broil (grill) on high heat during the last 2-3 minutes of cooking until golden and crisp.

7) Remove pan from oven, transfer chicken to serving plates and let rest for 5 minutes before serving.

8) OPTIONAL STEP: While chicken is in the oven, melt butter in a small skillet. Sauté garlic until fragrant (30 seconds), and remove pan from heat. Stir in parsley, then pour butter mixture into pan juices, stirring well to combine all of the flavours together.

9) To serve, drizzle pan juices over the chicken and garnish with freshly chopped parsley.
