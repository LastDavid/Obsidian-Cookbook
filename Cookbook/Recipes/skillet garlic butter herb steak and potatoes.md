## Ingredients
- [ ] 1 tablespoon olive oil- [ ] 1 tablespoon butter- [ ] 1 pound yukon gold potatoes, sliced about ½ inch in thickness- [ ] 3 garlic cloves, minced- [ ] 1 teaspoon thyme, chopped- [ ] 1 teaspoon rosemary, chopped- [ ] 1 teaspoon oregano, chopped- [ ] 2 lean New York Steak strip steaks- [ ] salt and pepper- [ ] Garlic Butter Compound:- [ ] ¼ cup softened butter- [ ] 3 garlic cloves, minced- [ ] 1 teaspoon thyme, chopped- [ ] 1 teaspoon rosemary, chopped- [ ] 1 teaspoon oregano, chopped

## Steps
1) In a large cast iron skillet over medium high heat, add olive oil and butter, potatoes, garlic, thyme, rosemary and oregano. Cook for about 3 minutes, stir and cook and additional 3 minutes or until fork tender. Remove and set on a plate.

2) Turn the skillet to high heat. Add the steaks. Cook on each side for 3 minutes or until outside is browned. Reduce heat to medium high. Cook the steaks to desired doneness. Mine took about 10 minutes flipping 3 times to get a medium well.

3) Right before the steaks are done, make the garlic butter compound. Mix the butter, garlic and fresh chopped herbs. Slather on top of steaks. Add the potatoes back to the pan and heat through and let the butter melt into the steaks.
