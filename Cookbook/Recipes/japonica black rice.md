Servings: 4

## Ingredients
- [ ] For the Absorption Method:- [ ] 1 cup black rice, rinsed- [ ] 2 1/4 cup water- [ ] 1/8 tsp salt or to taste- [ ] For the Pasta Method:- [ ] 1 cup black rice, rinsed- [ ] 6 cups water- [ ] 1 1/2 tsp salt or to taste- [ ] For the Pilaf Method:- [ ] 1 Tbsp olive oil- [ ] 1/4 medium onion, thinly sliced- [ ] 1 garlic clove, minced- [ ] 1 cup black rice- [ ] 2 1/4 cup water- [ ] 1/8 tsp salt or to taste

## Steps
For the Absorption Method:

1) Add water and rinsed black rice to a saucepan.

2) Over medium-high heat, bring the water to a boil. Add the salt, reduce heat, cover and cook for about 30-35 minutes. (Don't open the lid too often because this will let a lot of steam out.) Continue cooking until the rice is tender and chewy and all water is absorbed.

3) Take off the heat and let it stand covered for about 5 to 10 minutes then fluff with a fork and serve.

For the Pasta Method:

1) Add the water, rinsed black rice, and salt to a large pot. Bring to a boil and cook for about 30 to 35 minutes until the rice is tender and chewy.

2) Strain the black rice using a mesh colander.

For the Pilaf Method:

1) In a saucepan, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the onion, and cook stirring occasionally until the onion is translucent for about 2 minutes then add the garlic and cook for about 30 seconds.

2) Add the black rice and cook, stirring until the grains are well coated in oil and become fragrant.

3) Add the water and salt and bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover and cook until the black rice is tender and chewy for about 30 to 35 minutes.

4) Take the rice off the heat and let it stand covered for about 5 to 10 minutes then fluff with a fork and serve.


## Notes
Troubleshooting for the absorption and pilaf methods:

If all the water has evaporated but the rice is not cooked yet, add 2 to 3 tablespoons of water and cook for 5 more minutes.

What to keep in mind for the absorption and pilaf methods:

The time and water to rice ratio required to cook the perfect black rice very much depend on the amount of water that evaporates during cooking. And this, in turn, depends on your cooking environment such as the saucepan and lid you are using, the humidity in your area, the altitude you live in, etc. So, you might need to experiment to determine the ratio and timing that works best for you.
