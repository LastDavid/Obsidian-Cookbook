- [ ] 2 tablespoons chili powder- [ ] 2 teaspoons ground cumin- [ ] 2 teaspoons salt- [ ] 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder- [ ] 1 medium red onion, halved and cut into 1/4-inch slices- [ ] 2 medium red or yellow bell peppers, cut into 1/4-inch strips- [ ] 1/4 cup vegetable oil- [ ] 1 1/3 lb beef flank steak- [ ] 6 tortillas from 1 package (8.2 oz) Old El Paso™ flour tortillas for soft tacos & fajitas- [ ] Lime wedges, sour cream, Old El Paso™ mild salsa, guacamole, chopped fresh cilantro, as desired

## Steps
1) Position oven rack 4 inches from broiler. Spray 18x13x1-inch pan with cooking spray. In small bowl, mix chili powder, cumin, salt and garlic powder.

2) In large bowl, toss onion, bell peppers, 2 tablespoons of the vegetable oil and 1 tablespoon of the seasoning mixture; mix until evenly coated. Transfer vegetable mixture to pan in single layer, allowing room for steak. In same bowl, add remaining 2 tablespoons oil and remaining seasoning mixture. Add steak; rub mixture into steak. Transfer steak to pan with vegetables.

3) Broil 9 to 11 minutes, stirring vegetables once, until instant-read thermometer inserted in thickest part of steak reads 135°F (for medium). Transfer steak to cutting board; cover with foil. Let stand 5 minutes. Stir vegetables, and return to oven 2 to 6 minutes or until vegetables are blackened in spots.

4) Thinly slice steak on the bias, against the grain. Serve with vegetables in tortillas with remaining ingredients.

Feel free to use your favorite bell pepper, and add color by choosing a variety like yellow, red and orange.
