Healthy one pot beef stroganoff

Servings: 6

## Ingredients
- [ ] 1 tbsp olive oil- [ ] 2 small yellow onions or shallots, diced Go with shallots for a richer flavour if you have some on hand- [ ] 2 cloves garlic minced- [ ] 1 cup chopped mushrooms- [ ] 1/4 cup red wine- [ ] 2 Carrots finely chopped- [ ] 2 stalks celery finely chopped- [ ] 1 lb ground beef- [ ] 1 tsp salt- [ ] 1/2 tsp pepper- [ ] 1 small red pepper, diced- [ ] 2 tbsp flour- [ ] 2 cups beef broth- [ ] 2 cups cooked egg noodles- [ ] 1/2 cup sour cream or Greek yogurt- [ ] 2 cups chopped fresh spinach

## Steps
1) Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook egg noodles for 3-4 minutes, then drain and set aside. Noodles should be semi-hard still (we don't want them to be too soft or they will disintegrate later on)

2) Heat olive oil over med-high heat in large pot. Add onions/shallots and garlic, saut√©ing for 1 min until fragrant. Add mushrooms, carrots and celery, cooking for about 3-4 min until mushrooms start to release liquid and veggies are tender.

3) Add ground beef and cook until browned, then add red wine, salt and pepper and flour, tossing to combine.

4) Add beef stock and cooked noodles, bringing to a boil and cooking for 1-2 minutes until mixture starts to thicken. Stir in sour cream, red pepper and spinach, then remove from heat. Serve and enjoy!

5) Freeze leftovers in individual portion sizes in glass bowls or foil containers. If using foil, reheat in 375F oven for 45 min. If using glass bowls, reheat in microwave on high for 5-6 minutes, stirring halfway through and adding 1-2 tsp of water or milk to add more moisture.
