Servings: 8

## Ingredients
- [ ] 1 Tbsp olive oil- [ ] 2 lbs lean ground beef- [ ] 1 large yellow onion, finely chopped- [ ] 3 cloves garlic, finely minced- [ ] 2 (14.5 oz) cans diced tomatoes with green chilies*- [ ] 3 (8 oz) cans tomato sauce- [ ] 1/2 cup beef broth- [ ] 2 Tbsp chili powder- [ ] 2 1/2 tsp ground cumin- [ ] 2 tsp paprika- [ ] 2 tsp unsweetened cocoa powder- [ ] 1 tsp granulated sugar- [ ] 1/2 tsp ground coriander- [ ] Salt and freshly ground black pepper- [ ] 1 (15 oz) can dark red kidney beans, drained and rinsed- [ ] 1 (15 oz) can light red kidney beans, drained and rinsed- [ ] Shredded cheddar cheese, for serving

## Steps
1) Heat olive oil in a large and deep non-stick skillet over medium-high heat.

2) Add onion and saute 3 minutes, then add garlic and saute 30 seconds longer. Pour onions into a 6 or 7 quart slow cooker.

3) Return skillet to medium-high eat, add beef and cook stirring occasionally until beef has browned.

4) Drain most of fat from beef, leaving about 2 Tbsp in with beef (this is optional, I think it ads flavor but you can drain it all if you'd prefer). Pour browned beef into slow cooker.

5) Stir in diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, beef broth, chili powder, cumin, paprika, cocoa powder, sugar, coriander and season mixture with salt and pepper to taste.

6) Cover with lid and cook on low heat for 5 - 6 hours.

7) Stir in dark and light red kidney beans and allow to heat through, about 2 minutes. Serve warm with desired toppings.


## Notes
Look for tomatoes with "mild" green chilies. You can also use 2 (14.5 oz) cans diced tomatoes and 1 (4 oz) can green chilies, drained.

If you want beef to brown better then sear in two batches. Only crumble and stir occasionally.

To add even more depth of flavor you can bloom the spices by sautéing them with the aromatics, add them during the last minute of sautéing the onions.

If you want to thin the chili at the end you can add in another 1/2 cup beef broth. If you like a really thick chili you can omit the beef broth altogether.

Other topping ideas include sour cream, chopped red or green onions, roasted peppers, or hot sauce.

If desired serve with baked potatoes, cornbread, biscuits, saltine crackers or tortilla chips.
