# One-Cup Pancakes

Adapted from https://www.purewow.com/recipes/one-cup-pancakes

Servings: 10 TO 12 PANCAKES (2 TO 3 SERVINGS)

## Ingredients
- [ ] 1 egg- [ ] 1 level cup self-rising flour- [ ] 1 cup milk (either dairy milk or a plant-based milk)- [ ] Pinch of sea salt- [ ] 1 or 2 pats of butter (salted or unsalted)

## Steps
1) Crack the egg into a large mixing bowl. Using a cup or mug, measure out the level cup of flour and add it to the bowl. Repeat with the milk and add the salt. Using a balloon whisk, mix until you have a fairly smooth batter.

Warm a large skillet over a high heat. Add half a pat of butter to the pan and heat until bubbling, swirling it around so that the melted butter coats the base and sides.

Spoon 2 tablespoons of batter into the pan to form a small pancake. Continue spooning in more batter—you’ll probably fit 3 or 4 pancakes in your pan at once, but make sure there’s plenty of space between them—it’ll make flipping easier. Cook fewer pancakes at a time, if necessary.

Cook the pancakes on one side for about 2 minutes then, using a spatula, carefully flip them over and cook on the other side until nicely golden, about 2 minutes more. (You may need to reduce the heat to medium if the pan is getting too smoky.) Transfer to a plate.

Add another pat of butter to the pan and continue to make more pancakes until you’ve used up all the batter.
