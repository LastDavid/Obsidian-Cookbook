## Notes
Ingredient notes

Green pepper: Ever since a reader told me she enjoys diced green pepper in home-style ground beef dishes… I’ve been hooked! But I understand d not everybody is into green pepper, to feel free to either leave it out or use a stick of diced celery instead.

Brown sugar: Sloppy joes definitely have that salty/sweet taste, so I do like to add the brown sugar here. Feel free to skip it, but it will alter the taste.

Worcestershire sauce: This is a must in the recipe for me, just adds some depth and flavor. Soy sauce can be used as a substitute.

Ketchup: Try using barbecue sauce in place of the ketchup for a fun twist on the recipe!
